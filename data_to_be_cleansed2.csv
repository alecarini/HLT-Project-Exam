Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.","Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis",1
1,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",1

3,"I’m just so ashamed. Everyone and everything feels so far away. Every time I leave my house, I feel like I’m drowning in an ocean while watching people on the shore having a grand old time. I feel like everyone else is on a whole other plane of existence, meanwhile I’m stuck beneath the surface just trying to breathe. 

Every time I talk to someone, I have to check to see if there’s something on my face once I leave because other people don’t know what to say to me and it’s always so fucking awkward. I try so hard to appear normal, but other people see right through it. I can’t relate to anyone. I can’t talk to anyone. I try so hard but I just can’t.

And it’s embarrassing. I feel stupid for being this way. I’ve tried so hard to fix myself and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’ve been in therapy for over a decade and the only thing that’s changed is I’m really good at talking about myself.",Being Depressed is Embarrassing,1

5,"Hear me out... life in general sucks. We have to work the majority of our time in jobs we hate for people we don't care about to earn just about enough to live relatively comfortably. 

The majority of people are selfish assholes who only care about themselves. Me, you and 99.9% of people included whether we admit it or not.

To me optimistic people seem mentally ill. I dint see the appeal in pretending that we're not all fucking miserable. (Also if I hear one more person talk about ""manifesting"" happiness I may be doing 25 to life)

6,"Never in a million years did I think I’d be on Reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain. I’ve been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late &amp; I feel like I’m just unable to get a grip on anything. 

1. My father passed away &amp; I hadn’t spoken to him in well over 10yrs prior to his passing. He was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed. I am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the “what if” things in relation to a better childhood.

2. I found out that my sister is not 100% my sister &amp; we don’t have the same father &amp; we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who I also don’t have the best relationship with. We did DNA tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now it’s a waiting game. I live in the same house as her &amp; have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis.

3. The girl I have been in a situation-ship doesn’t feel the same way I do about her. This one hurts me so much, honestly more in a sense than my dad passing. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends &amp; love one another. I never thought I’d catch feelings for her but here we are. We have a beautiful friendship , the sex is great &amp; we have so many great laughs &amp; moments. She’s been such a bright spot in my dark times lately. I wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesn’t feel how I do. This now is breaking my heart &amp; don’t know how to navigate it. I don’t want to just get rid of her as a friend, I genuinely care about her. She is fine with continuing what we are doing but I’m not sure I can do that right now with how I feel about her. 

Everything is just compounding ontop of eachother &amp; I feel like I’m suffocating. My appetite is shot, I feel restless where I feel like I’m going crazy &amp; I’ve been having very dark thoughts &amp; find humor in self harm jokes to myself &amp; my close friends. 

Maybe this is a cry for help, maybe I’m trying. I’m not sure. But if anyone reads this &amp; has advice or a heart to be here for me I would love &amp; cherish your kindness. Thank you .",Could really use someone to talk to. I’m falling apart,1
7,"Hi!! 

I want to preface by saying, i’m sorry, because i know this is completely and totally selfish of me to ask. 

There’s a million things i want to say or express, but i feel like i can only do it with someone who understands. Or at the very least, someone who isn’t directly involved. 

I’m sorry, i don’t want to be a burden, but that’s what i’m asking, i think. If there’s any chance some lovely amazing person would let me burden them, just for a bit, i would appreciate it with my whole heart (or whatever is left of it aha)",Can i rant to someone?? You can rant in return!!,1
8,"I’m 40(M) and I’ve always maintained that I’m too ugly for women and that hasn’t changed.  Then my not long ago my therapist talked me into using a dating app to get experience to chatting with women and to get over fears of rejection.

I didn’t like the idea but I did it anyway.  Well I think it is fair to say that it was the final straw, because the only women who were (allegedly) interested were women in foreign countries, sure they were highly educated (they claimed) and quite a few of them were not bad looking but I zero matches from us women.

Long story short, I was talking to this female doctor in the Dominican Republic and most of our conversations had to be done with google translate because she didn’t speak much English.  Well after a while I realized that this was going nowhere and I politely told her that we needed to go our separate ways and unmatched her.

A few days later I decided that enough was enough, I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt that I’m too ugly and need to just embrace being alone for life.   But my brain won’t let me, I keep having to remind myself to not go back to the app, to just find ways to help people and be content alone but again my mind keeps obsessing about being alone so that I find myself needing to vent several times a day and it’s pathetic.

9,"I used to get through my life by believing in the delusion that things were all going to work out one day and I’d find my place in the world.

I cannot fucking believe that this is what life is, but I guess I just got unlucky. Some people get to have loving parents, close friends, romantic partners, and a career they enjoy that makes them enough money to live on. And some of us get none of those things. We get left to rot in shitty minimum-wage jobs, ignored by all the girls or boys in school, treated like shit by everyone who was supposed to care about us. We get nothing and yet we’re expected to be grateful for a life empty of everything that makes it worth living. So I think I’m done with all of this nonsense.

I don't consider myself ugly, I think I'm just mid. I nurture many passions, am very extroverted and outgoing, and I believe I'm quite smart, but especially in these last 3 years I've been feeling extremely hollow and sad, and the reason why is no matter what I do or how much I keep improving myself, I seem to have no luck with girls. Yesterday I went out with this great girl I met in university 2 years ago, which I've been texting on and off with. I thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out, but as I later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying. I promised myself to go into that ""date"" with no expectations but of course there was hope things would go well. However, as per usual, I had to go back home and cry myself to sleep for the 100th time and I'm just tired of this endless repeating cycle.

12,"20M

I feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips; i cant remember much anymore, i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore; at least not the ones that ive done already (which is just about everything). I have all the desire in the world to get better, but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time, and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.

My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up, do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week, then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks, which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing, but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.

The thought that really bugs me the most, the reason for making this post in the first place, tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner, but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine, but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally, but during my episodes, they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up, everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend, and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends, and i always hated being alone, and i still do; which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore, im a completely different person than the one i used to know.

The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future, and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life, or if im going to feel happy and content ever again, or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually, and i cant feel like this forever, but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal, i dont have a desire to stop living, and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living, functioning person.

I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally, but im afraid of them.","my depression keeps getting worse, and i want to stop pushing away the people i love.",1

I was never able to talk to girls either but somehow 3 years ago I met one and we fell in love but we broke up recently and a lot due to me not having a life and being able to make friends but during this time she was the only thing motivating me to keep going.

19,"Please help me. 

I am so exhausted. For as long as I can remember, probably from about 5 years old, I have been hideous. 

I was an extremely shy kid and had selective mutism, so I was always self conscious. I just can’t remember not being this way. When I started elementary school, kids would constantly comment on my looks. They compared me to skeletons, zombies, and dead bodies. The few friends I had were  told “Don’t be friends with her, she’s too ugly for you, you can do so much better.” I wasn’t allowed to sit with anyone in the cafeteria in middle school and I had to stay in the library away from everyone. People left notes in my locker calling me all sorts of names. In high school people just ignored me and I was so lonely. Then at home my parents would occasionally get angry and call me a lazy pig.

I know people have had it worse, so the worry of me being too dramatic makes it even more unbearable.

I’m going to graduate college soon. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship, any men have just taken advantage of me. However I am extremely lucky to have a few supportive friends who have tried to help me. 

Since less people actively hurt me nowadays, I expected this to get better. But if anything it’s getting worse. My nose is crooked, my lips are uneven, one of my eyes is smaller than the other. I have crooked teeth despite constantly wearing my retainer. My skin is horrible and I have this weird skin discolouration resembling a mustache that I have never been able to get rid of. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have been to therapy, I have tried body neutrality, meditation, anything you can think of. Nothing helps. I spend my days obsessing over my looks and my nights crying myself to sleep. I alternate between staring at myself for hours trying to figure out what I did to deserve to be this ugly, to having to shower in the dark and avoiding mirrors because I can’t stand to look at myself. It is utterly exhausting to hate myself this much. 

I know deep down looks aren’t everything. But being pretty would be so much easier. I don’t understand why I was dealt these cards, why I have these disgusting genes. I know other people suffer from this, but they all have redeeming qualities. I am a monster. And I need to be beautiful. I can’t stand anything else anymore.

She came back and was back into a calm state herself which is quite a normal thing for her and she came in my room and comforted me. I kept breaking into tears while she was talking to my cat. After the situation she calmed me down after about 30 minutes of a continued panic attack.

31,"Hello

I've been having this issue for years now and it seems to make everything worse than it should be. 

I've been trying to reach out for help for 7 years now (I'm 21 now). I've been trying to tell my mom what's happening, telling her why I can't seem to get out of bed for days on end sometimes, telling her that I need help, and everytime the conversation happens it feels like she finally gets what I'm saying. She never does. Everytime she gets upset at me she asks why I'm always in bed, why a person my age is always tired and never really doing anything or going anywhere,  and Everytime it just makes me feel both worse and insane. I've straight up told her that I've thought/attempted suicide before and all she had to say was ""oh really?"" in a tone that suggested that I didn't have it hard enough to do that. 

I don't understand why she keeps doing this, why she keeps asking me what's wrong when I've told her a thousand times. It's making me feel like I'm making everything up, that I'm going crazy. If anyone went through something like this and has some tips or anything that could help, please please tell me. I don't know what to do at this point, I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.",Why can't my mom see that I'm depressed?,1

33,"So, I can't anymore. I didn't think I would get here. I hope it won't be a long post. Thank you in advance.
F(26) I've always been the soul of the party, the kind of person you love to be around. Always joking, with super positive energy. Few people know what I'm like in my spare time, and that in fact there isn't a day when I don't wish to die.
If someone can understand that I feel alone since I was little. I have always sought to be seen, appreciated, respected.
My parents divorced when I was 5 years old. Since then, the relationship with my father has not been, because he is the most lying person I know. All my life he just promised me things and never kept his word. Now he has his family, which he does not take care of. Her children live with him, but they actually live like I did. My mother was always away in another country. He tried to compensate for the fact that all his life he ran after the perfect man and thus he neglected me. He never chose me. To want to move together to do something new 2. She chose men who, I'm sorry, did to her. And I had to grow up with my grandparents. With my grandfather always beating my grandmother. I saw all kinds of arguments, fights, scandals and everything that a child should not see. I always grew up with words like ""you're not good for anything, you don't know how to do anything, you're like my mom, you're like tactu"" My mother has 2 brothers, who are super narcissists. That they gave me a juice when I was younger ""they raised me"". Grandma raised the men of the family as if everything was theirs. And my mother and I always had to do everything. From food, cleaning, money... Everything. No, they are men and we are women. Ever since I was little, I used to fight with everyone, because I was always different. I don't consider that my purpose is to find a man, to have a child and that's...as my family wants. I always wanted more. Because of this, my jobs were not exactly easy either. I was a team leader at 19, and it still wasn't enough, although no one in the family did more than me...
My grandfather died 2 years ago, and since then the family fell apart even more. My mother left again to another country, after her boyfriend who is my age and treats her worse than anything.. and I stay at home with my grandmother, who is also mean.
I tried everything, to meditate, to go to a psychologist, to stop thinking about all the things. Anything...
I feel alone, abandoned. As everyone sees their life, I remain here behind, worthless, with nothing. I have nothing. Not a day goes by that I don't think I want to die... Thank you.",there is no day when I don't want to die,1

I feel really stuck. 

And I know many people are gonna say it's procrastination and I get it might be, but it stems from an overflowing and ever-changing amounts of anxiety and depression that has never stopped. I can't afford therapy because that shit isn't covered, nor can I drive to one because I don't have a car nor do I have the money to pay for an Uber drive weekly along with whatever fee therapy comes with.bi also never have privacy so I can't do at home therapy. I have so little privacy my mom barges in and tries to talk to me even though I tell her I'm in a literal meeting. But if I try to set boundaries or do things myself I'm called an asshole... It's so much thrown at me I feel like I just freeze and just sit and do nothing because that's better than sitting with her and possibly be yelled and berated at for my weight for the umpth time even though she's heavy and diabetic herself.

I keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for 2 years but it doesn't meet the criteria of PTSD, but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasn't consistent, actually most of the time I was treated better except for some situations that I keep remembering till now. 

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety, panic, ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) 

I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.

I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. 

So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. 

I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision.

I recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago, and even though I am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now, my brain doesn’t seem to be functioning in any way. 

I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time. Like I really can’t catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly. And I feel like a zombie, just do everything based on experience and instinct.

And the worst part is, people don’t understand that because you look completely normal and functional. They think you’re fine now because you stop crying or being depressed. You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode, but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower, you are broken.

And sometimes it takes weeks or months to really snap out it but life doesn’t give you the luxury of doing that. It stresses me out.

When i am alone i get this certain feeling in my head of all my feelings trying to come out at the same time. I hold it in and it feels indescribable, like a literal wave nothingness that washes over me. Then i just hold the blankest face ever, i do this almost all the time except when listening to people and talking to them. Its so hard just observing my life with no feelings. Occasionally it will become too much and i overflow with tears and confusing feelings, but nobody knows this. I get this feeling of laughter and denial that turns into a feeling of sadness and tears.

108,"I've been depressed for a few years now. I don't feel totally lost. Somewhere inside me, I still have hope, I still have a real belief that it's possible for me to feel normal and happy again. But there's a much stronger feeling, an overwhelmingly powerful one, that even if I *could* be happy again, I don't deserve it. I don't deserve support from others, I don't deserve to make small gains for myself. Every time I start to move in a positive direction, every time others give me advice and offer help, every time it seems like I'm finally digging myself out of the hole.... I stop myself. I hurt myself. I don't let myself get better, because I feel like I don't deserve to be better. 

I hate it. It feels totally inescapable. No matter what progress or advantage I'm giving, I end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away, because I can't escape the feeling that I deserve nothing but suffering, that it's an injustice to the world if I get better.

Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist.

I am just acting things out in this elaborate drama I have constructed for myself so that I can feel like a victim of my own imagination, make up problems where there aren't any, and poach resources away from those actually suffering. 

You know I sometimes take a blade to my hand but I get scared. I get terrified, that probably is a primal instinct. That definitely means I am faking it all, right. If I really hated myself and wanted to kms, I'd be able to sink it deeper, with no regards to the pain. But noooo, all I can do is barely see the white.

139," (not saying people here are fake but I’ve become more of a hermit). Want to move back home and pursue schooling/certification (medical billing and coding). Feeling insanely depressed here.

So I made the move out here last year 2 months before turning 29. 

At first I enjoyed it. I’m able to buy weed whenever I want, I get a better pay than I did back home, and I don’t feel like a child living at home. And the weather was pretty nice.

But over time, it started wearing on me. I miss my nieces and every time we’ve factimed they look so much older. I feel sad that I’m not there. I miss my family and our family dog. Also I ran out of my ADHD/anxiety/depression medications and haven’t tried finding a new psychiatrist/therapist because I don’t want to deal with the hassle of searching around. 

I feel like I haven’t really connected to anyone here. I thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday, that someone would recognize me and I’d make friends (which is what happened back home), but it hasn’t happened. I have no dating life at all. I get 3 or 4 days off a week and spend them alone. Sometimes I’ll game with my high school friends online, which is the only thing I really look forward to, but this fucks my sleep schedule even more.

I work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore. I try sleeping during the day but it’s difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud. Why don’t they just wear headphones?

My sleep schedule is shit. I hate going to run errands because I have to walk 15 minutes to my car. 

I snowboard for like 2 hours and then feel like going home because I get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines.

Once the season ends, they’ll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights, but then I’ll have to get a roommate. Having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and I don’t like it. No privacy at all.

When I go back home, I want to start regularly going to therapy again, but am thinking “how can I do that if I don’t have a job”. How do I ensure I have a job when I get back home?

144,"Throwaway because the people in this post have reddit accounts. I (28F) am married to a wonderful man (32M) let’s call him Mark. We have been married for 7 years now and I grew very close to his family as they live in the same city as us while my family is in another country.

His brother Maison (30M) and I grew very close and we have a great friendship, laughing together, talking about life, etc… as time went by I started noticing that i was being supportive and there for him and the opposite isnt true.

Now for a little backstory, Maison went through a very tough phase in his life and got depressed and suicidal, he went to therapy and started getting back on his feet again but he was never the same. This happened 3 years ago and after that experience he became very self-centered, inconsiderate yet very sensitive and also does not accept any type of criticism. He literally turned to a manchild. Only wants to game all day, doesnt help the people around him, is very dependent even in the smallest things. Mark is always walking on eggshells around him for this reason because he is scared that he would say / do anything that will cause Maison to relapse into depression.

I on the other hand am a little tougher on Maison. I sometimes feel like his family not saying anything when he is rude or acting like a child because they are afraid to hurt his feelings are turning him into a very immature and irresponsible man who is never held accountable.

He moved in to live with us temporarily to save some rent money till he gets his life together. He adopted a dog, and let her go because he didnt train her properly and she became aggressive with separation anxiety. Then he adopted another dog and the same thing happened again and he let him go. He wants so many things in his life but wouldnt want to put the hard work or the responsibility.

My question is, should we go easy on him because of his mental health? Or is going easy on him will make his life harder later because he will get used to life without any responsibility or accountability?",Are we Supportive or destructive,1

But i realized i don’t enjoy socialization, they say humans thrive on socialization, but I don’t feel that I do.

People feels like a chore for some reason I never really miss my friends or miss going out with them.
Every time they ask me to go out I make up an excuse and humor them and on the rare occasion i did go with them I would go home early. They will try to prolong the outing as much as possible. Maybe have a couple of drinks and play video games late into the night but I genuinely can’t find it in me to wanna be around them and it isn’t about them as people they’re actually very sweet and accepting wonderful people. 

They are kind hearted and patient and one of them even cooks for us sometimes it isn’t about them. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I just can never seem to enjoy being around people it’s supposed to be healing to be a part of a community to feel like you belong, to go out with friends and to get out of the slump you are in. 
 
A lot of people tell me it’s not good to lay in bed all day or to be in inside your apartment, watching YouTube and movies and playing video games alone but I genuinely feel that I don’t have the same functions that other humans do I don’t have the thing that makes me want to be around others. It just isn’t an emotionally fulfilling experience. 

I don’t feel the need to be around other people and whenever I do go out with people, I look forward to just going home and relaxing and finally breathing and doing whatever i want.
I’m not sure why maybe it’s a personality clash? Maybe I just haven’t found my “people“ or someone that really understands me to the point where I would find their company enjoyable? I’m not sure all I know is I’ve never really had a friend that I wanted to spend that much time with if it were up to me, I would go weeks maybe even months without ever hanging out with friends even though I know it might be better for me mentally if I’m around people and put myself out there and meet new people as well but I genuinely do not crave human presence in my life and the happiest or at least the most content I’ve ever been is when I’m alone reading comics and drinking coffee in my bed.

It isn’t like I don’t want to have friends I really do, when I have friends I just don’t really see their presence or company as a priority or a need in my life other than a conversation every now and then I never really seem to want to spend my free time on them.

I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

168,"For as long as I can remember, I have always suffered from anxiety. Perhaps it runs in my family. Yet I was never able to name it or put a label on it. During COVID, it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage. For past half year, so much has happened in my life that I feel like I am living someone else's life. The only good thing that has come out of it, is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how I channel it. I am so heartbroken to see that I mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage. 

Anxiety builds up in me for various reasons. Sometimes, it is related to work, sometimes things not going my way, or sometimes pretty mundane things. It slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled. Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me. I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something. During COVID, the unfortunate victim became my spouse. I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time. So once I spoiled the mood around me, or picked up a fight, I would see that things are fucked up. I always blamed the spouse, work or boss for the fight or issues, yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments.

It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling. I feel so ashamed and resentful. The sad truth is that I don't see any quick remedy for this either. You see, there will always be some dormant resentments inside me. There are issues between me and my spouse, that we cannot agree on. There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc. And whenever anxiety builds up, it needs a channel for relief. I'm afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over.

I have come to this community to ask for your advice, that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time? I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive. I can't change my spouse, I can't get that promotion. But I can always put effort to find a new job, always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments. How does one make this change? How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too? I need some encouragement and guidance.

So I've been off work for a year now with severe MH, had 2 S attempts and multiple SH requiring hospitalisation last year. 

I'm on duloxetine 120mg for severe depression, underactive thyroid which I take lebothyroxine for,I have narcolepsy and take 200mg modafinil for that, and I have a blood disorder (cancer?) Currently undergoing tests. All these things major symptom is chronic exhaustion but I also have chronic pain (R knee operated on 2020 and currently waiting on L knee op), we're querying fibromyalgia. 

I applied for ADP in November last year, and submitted my part 2 in December. 
I submitted as part of my supporting evidence a short patient summary from my GP, my medication list (Inc up to date prescription repeats forms), letters from my therapist, letters from the police (involvement after S and severe SH), letters from my mental health team, letters from psych, and a letter from my GP detailing all above and support. 

I've heard nothing from ADP so today went to online chat and was told it's been picked up by a case manager (yay) , but that they've requested more SI from my GP. 

What?!?!?

What else could they need? And if they've requested that from GP it'll take months before I hear. It took my GP 5 months just to write the support letter they did write. 

So now I'm in an anxiety spiral because if they're gonna deny my claim I wish they would just fucking tell me instead of making me wait 6+months. All the while I can't afford my mortgage and I'm getting deeper and deeper in debt.

Some brief background info:
I have autism so I may not always understand all social cues. Neither my friend nor I live in the US.

I have a friend going through a hard time right now. He has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues. He's had depression before I even met him and have never seen him this low. He also has money problems and thus can't afford treatment for his physical issues atm. 

What's the best way to support him?
I cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 Whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. Whenever I talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that I'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". Whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. So he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

Yeah, withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.

Withdrawals are normal, so are discontinuation syndromes. You must go through it for 1 - 2 weeks, yes, very uncomfortable. I also suffered it. But this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness.

Since I move around a lot I can't get a real attachment to anyone which is sad for me with the exception is my GF of 7 soon to be 8 years. But I lately I've begun to realize that I feel more comfortable being a depressed guy than happy, it's more like I rather be sad and tired so others can be happy. For example my gf's family have taken me in as their own even giving me the nickname ""Mikwap"" (mee-gwap) which roughly translated to home in our language. 

Anyways, I wouldn't say no to them when they asked something of me. Nothing too crazy, simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do, lend them money when they need, or drive 4+ hours for an event. There are more things. But I do stuff like this for my actual family too and it's making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me.

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me.

My family is dead, or too abusive for me to risk speaking too. 

I have let countless opportunities get away from me and now my only skill is dishwashing and cooking, which I hate and I am forced to do it to survive and pay my rent.

I’m by no means physically attractive and constantly am told (subtly or not) that I am ugly. Really like my facial structure itself is terrible. I’m losing my hair at this early age, and have a gross and large surgery scar on my stomach. People look at me with disgust in public. I have such low self esteem I cannot ever stand up for myself and if I try I get laughed at. Constantly treated with no respect unless it’s sympathy or pity, and I’m very awkward and weird.

I always make mistakes, can’t handle myself under pressure, constantly miss things and can barely make life decisions on my own, which I’m forced to do because I don’t have anyone else. It’s like my brain is a level lower than everyone else’s. When I have a chat with people they can insult me and I don’t even realise because I am so slow until later and then I feel so upset and resentful.

I had a group of friends , they are all good looking and live at home with their parents so they are able to have so much money to party and hangout , as we’ve grown out of Highschool age they’ve seen as I’ve devolved and aged badly and how pathetic, spineless and valueless I really am. I feel like I’ve been exposed. Now I don’t get invited , and when I do occasionally see them for something I can afford , I am the pathetic butt of the joke.

I used to have girls interested with me , perhaps because I was younger and better looking and confident because I was unaware. Now I seriously have no chance .

I don’t know how to have social interactions anymore, and I always feel like I said the wrong thing, that I’m different from other people in a terrible way. 

Out of sync with life and destined to be one of the unfortunate disgusting underclass.

The only thing that stops me from ending it all is that I have a sister who is younger than me and I am quite close with. She is well put together and successful, and since she has no family either I know how much it’ll devastate her to lose me.

227,"Hello

I dont know whats wrong with me. Nothing in life is fun, brings me joy or motivates me. All i wish is to lie in bed all day and stare at the wall.

I opened this thread because lately i have more and more thoughts  like ""whats the point of this? why do this another 60years?"" and after another successful ski weekend with family i just prefered to stay in bed after skiing for 10min.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not something that just started to happen a few weeks ago. It follows me since childhood i would say. Nothing ever motivated or brought me joy me except computer games as kid but not even games nowadays bring me joy at all. Somehow i got through all schools till university without doing anything and missing about 20% of classes. Even in university my motvation is still equal 0 and thus I am still stuck in bachelor after 6years.I write exams from time to time because i guess thats something you have to do in life but my motivation is negativ. But when Ifind a tiny bit of motivation to write an exam, I usually write very good grades while not attended 1 class at uni over all these years but they dont make me happy nor motivate me for more.

But its definitely not the issue with the chosen path. I tried different part time jobs like char mech, hotelero(?), sales (not retail), vet or logistics. ZERO motivation for any of it. It always started fine while I kept up my mask but usually after few weeks I couldn't find motivation to stand up anymore and quit. But also here they usually were happy with me and few even called me year later to help out again during summer holiday etc.

I dont find any sports enjoyable. handball,unihockey,ski,sailing,boxing,... tried and tried nothing lasted over a month, except gym once because I thought all my problems are because of my physical appearance. Not even this gave me any motivation even though after intensive few months I got way more attention from women, people treated me better and so on. A normal human would be so happy with this change, for me it was whatever lets go back to bed!

&amp;#x200B;

This no motivation follows me everywhere! I had a few romances including two longer relationships which lasted 1years and 2years with very beautiful&amp;great character women. BUT the same problem again NO MOTIVATION. Obviously I fucked up and they eventually left because I had no motviation to put any effort in. 

I have great friends since childhood. Even now almost towards 30y they still meet multiple times per month and go on holiday 1-3 times /year since we are 18. even here NO MOTIVATION i usually join the holiday once a year but this is like enough. It is just not fun to me to hang out. No they are very good people, alone for the fact they still ask me out even tho i go deep sea most of the year. I just dont want to deal with any humans i guess.

Kinda same with my family. I could call them any time and the financials are covered by my father. I just dont want to be alone.

what i tried so far:

3x different therapist, ambulant weekly session =&gt; completley useless. I lose motivation to go there after few times and dont feel i achieved anything ever from talking

medicaments =&gt; worst decision ever. While it completley killed all my thoughts which i enjoyed i had even less motivation to leave my bed and the sweating side effects made it even worse. What a wasted year until i found the motivation to contact someone and say what happened.

clinic =&gt; after 1 week i just wanted to leave and this stayed with me for the remaining 2months. Felt like a waste of time i had 0 motivation and every morning to stand up was a fight with my inner self.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: no motivation or joy in life since childhood for anything. literally 0 and i just wonder whats the point to live another 60 years laying in bed?

good grades? hot gf? amazing friends? good looking? nothing brings joy

228,"My spouse cheated on me a long time ago, after which things became pretty good. She was nice to me, worked her way to get me back, and make me love her. Which I did for about 3-4 years and then I started feeling the urge to have someone else in my life and see what it feels like to be with someone else than my wife. I went down the worse path, I lied to someone about my marriage being in turmoil and how I still feel neglected by my spouse. I started giving more time to the affair over calls and WhatsApp, instead of providing the necessary time to my wife and daughter.

Recently everyone found out about this, as the woman I was involved with was talking to me while her husband was home. Now her husband informed everything to my wife. I am constantly trying to say sorry and ask for forgiveness. My wife is talking to the other women and she is providing more details about what I used to say and not. 

During this affair sometimes I will feel weird about patching up with my wife but will stop myself and withdraw myself because I used to feel it was unjust to her while I am in another relationship. To touch her kiss her or even say I loved her. I am this horrible human being and I feel I don't deserve any of them. 

Now I have a hard time just living let alone working. I wish my wife forgives me. I tried talking her into marriage counseling but her point is you have mental issues, why should she suffer?

Cant look into my daughter's eyes (she doesn't know anything). Same with Mom. My only support system in the world after I lost my dad this year was my brother. He knows everything about this now and is withdrawn from me, and anyway, he lives in a different country. 

I will be ok living alone too, I mean I will understand if my wife leaves me now. She has not decided anything yet. But to stay like this, it's difficult, do I have a right to live?

240,"Hello,

My (now ex) SO has been diagnosed with depression. We have had a wonderful relationship built upon many common interests and values, and family blending. He pursued me, and we both wanted a serious committment. 

He admitted he felt depressed to me 2 months ago, when I asked him why we had been struggling to do outside things together. There are a few large situational stressors in his life atm, but he had not expressed the severity of some of these to me until now.

I feel I see the worst of it, but friends get his 'all fine here' mask. Family seem to see more of it too, but they also come across quite critical which I feel makes him withdraw more.

* He seems to not be able to make plans in advance anymore, even of a few days, meaning I cannot clarify if we will see each other until hours/late at night the day before. I have asked him what we could do to make this easier, work with how he thinks etc but he has not suggested anything. 
* When I am visiting him, he is often engrossed in his cellphone, or just wants to watch TV in bed. The feel of absence hurts, but I try to co-exist and just be there. I have expressed this can be upsetting, and that idm if we do our own things together, but I need some of our time to be more about us interacting. This has been up and down, with things having seemed better lately.
* He has become more irritable, sometimes snapping at me or just seeming short all day. I can't seem to get anything right. 
* I feel like we are always having a conversation through a different filter. I could be talking about something abstract, and he will somehow interpret it as a criticism. eg. the other day I had mentioned a friend bought new clothes for her partner as he was in need of some replacements, and SO took this as a sly comment at him to update his own wardrobe. 
* I try to do nice things for him, leaving notes, bringing comfort items, making food, offering to talk if he needs to. He never wants to talk, and the nice things seem to leave little impact after an hour.
* The task of organising our time together is mostly mine, I have asked he share more of this how he can, such as both of us deciding on food options sometimes or suggesting something to do (just home stuff like movies) but this seems to have caused more strain despite him saying he was happy to do it.
* He has admitted he struggles to discuss his own feelings but also told me he will always be honest, which is now untrue as he seems unable to do so. 
* When I try to talk about my feelings on a matter (related or unrelated) he tends to get frozen up and doesnt say much. If it involves him in any way, he has been snapping more and recently and told me he does not have to talk about things just because I want to. I was hurt.

Things took a turn recently, and he ended it. I was confused, as things had been on the up that week. He had started meds a few weeks prior, and had a promotion. 

He said he doesn't know if we fit together but cannot explain why, then that it was actually him because he cannot sustain a relationship right now, then that he doesn't know who he is and just wants to be alone to figure himself out and cannot see ahead of himself or focus. But said he loves me and thinks I deserve better.

I don't know what to think. Is this typical of anyone else's experience with depression and their SO? If so, what did you feel when it was you? Did you come back to your partner if your symptoms improved or you recieved working treatment? 

I have been depressed before, but recovered with treatment, however I can see all our experiences will differ and how people react to a partner will not always be the same. It manifested differently for me, so I am seeking insight and advice on how to proceed.",Depression in relationships. Did you leave? Would you return?,1

yesterday I decided to go cold turkey on the Olanzapine and Vilazodone HCL, but not the Trintellix. Is that safe and will there be any long lating withdrawal effects?

so far the only thing i noticed is nausea, dizzines, and my body being extremly fatigued with a slight headache.",is it safe to go cold turkey after 2 weeks?,1
255,"Hey everyone,

a friend of mine struggels a lot since a few years. she is 59yo and about 4 years ago her mom got sick and she cared for her til the mom died. they lived in the same house. her adult daughter is on a different continent and cares pretty much for herself only -wich is ok, they have a good realationship, i just try to draw the whole picture. She lost a close friend to cancer in december, they have spent nearly every day together.
 
Since 2 years she isnt able to work because of her depression. 2 months ago she tried to explain to her doctor that she wants to work again, not fulltime, just to get back some routine in her days. doc declined. 
 
Now shes at home most of her time. Alone. Her loved cat died earlier this year. she says the whole house just feel dead to her and she is so lonley there. But at the same time she doesnt want to be around others. i know that every time i visit her she struggles and is always close to cancel, but knows that she feels a little better afterwards. 
 
she is calling for help -indirectly. i get the calls. she wants back some structure in her days. she wants to help someone by reading books for kids or a women in a wheelchair who is helpless. But she cant bring herself to do it. 
 
I dont want to push her to much. But i also have to strong urge to help her somehow. more than visit her once a week and listen to her. But i dont know how. i cant imagine the situation she is going throuht. i cant relate to that feeling but i want her to get better and be that brave, wise, strong and creative person she was before. she wants help but i dont know how. she cant bring herself and i dont wanna be to pushy.
 
i thouhgt maybe you guys can give me some advice!
 
ps: she is in therapy",how to be there for a depressed friend?,1

258,"I am not able to do anything , had some ""mental breakdowns"" i am scared to call people or socialise , even though i am a empath ,i keep extreme anger with me and can´t controll it , sometimes i just start to rage for small things cuz i feel like beeing on the edge at all times. I keep getting more hopeless the more days i life on this planet.

Hyperfocused but then slow in thoughts and processing things.

Hungry but not wanting to eat.

Feelings of extreme tension and not-knowing my future due to big problems with work/education , family relationships , legal problems , substance abuse , traumatic stressful events happened often in my life, disresepect from many people around me ,that think i am just a lazy ,looser, too stupid to go to work and live a normal life( that shit hurts bad when feeling i do everything my body could )

&amp;#x200B;

The moment i got myself some help was when my suicidal thoughts got really bad and kept cycling lots of times a day in my head  and crying , lying on the floor and sleeping too much without the good feeling of rest and beeing awake.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a dream days ago : Of me beeing in a city and very very strong winds would blow , the people seem to walk normal and don´t feel the force but i feel it and need all my energy to take slow small steps , people watch me and look at me like i was doing something wrong , i felt like this describes how i feel best ( thank you subconscious ) there´s alot of suffering included that i can´t explain (feelings of guilt , not beeing able to move like everyone else) i feel tho as it would be a good metaphor for people to understand my point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a half-brother that is rather unsupportive and just saying something if he complains or wants me to feel bad , when i told him about my depression there wouldn´t be much said but then after a few weeks he felt like he should joke a bit about that and not taking it serious. Well brother you are not invincible to depression , take care in the future i told him and he shouldn´t be like that because it´s A very serious and dangerous illness ( his mom had a suicide attempt and is schizophrenic but he still doesnt understand the situation for me ) . I think he is a stuck soul and using narcissist behaviour to feel better about himself.

I´ve seen things when i was younger that a child wasn´t supposed to see.

&amp;#x200B;

for example :

A friends sister was a heroin addict and i saw her tripping hardcore with 8-11 years of age.

I saw real and brutally disturbing footage of ISIS and 2 people get decapitated with chainsaw and a knife , with 11 years.

I saw some other nasty footages of suicides and other things that you shouldn´t watch as a kid ( horror movies aswell but they were not as disturbing )

Took some LSD when i was older , then the friend of a friend came home(who was a hunter) with a plastic bag and the head of a baby deer bloody nasty and not good when your on LSD)

I´ve always had problems with my family and respect due to conflict with everything outside my home and then coming home and listening to financial problems of my mom and how my dad betrayed her and sh\*t just overloaded me (ALWAYS)

All that stuff is terrible and if u have kids , don´t let them ever live a life like that , u are fcked real bad afterwards. My brain is not the same , i have mental breakdowns nearly everyday. And suicidal ideation is just the good part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my thoughts are hella aggressive and dark , sometimes when i just see words like bloodthirst , bloodshed i seem to calm down and I´m good , is this how my brain copes with things now? it needs trauma and horrifying things to calm down?

&amp;#x200B;

I watch myself as a person that tries it´s best to keep going but not having people that understand mental illness and not providing support in a healthy way.. And bad things happen to me all the time but i keep going cuz the immortality of our soul is not bound to this earth but to the universe , so you can´t escape , not even with deleting yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like i can´t ever escape but it somehow is good to deal with my problems rather than ignoring them.

266,"the more I learned about nutrition the more I applied it to my diet, then one day I couldnt afford healthy foods and had to eat processed foods and a few times had fast food because it was better than declining and getting no calories at all. 

by the end of the first day I was doing worse again. I didn’t notice the correlation until a week later when I could get healthy food again and saw the recent things I ate (I’ve been keeping track to do the math on how much nutrition I was getting)

by the end of the day after eating healthy foods again, not even getting close to the proper amount for my age and weight, just having some I felt noticeably better. I was more productive,able to focus a bit more, moving wasnt something I had to work up motivation for, and I didn’t have to spend as much time getting myself out of the ‘I wanna lay here until I start to decay’ kinda mind.

its kinda soul crushing and liberating at the same time. after a childhood of depression, trauma, neglect, then a few years of pure hell and not feeling any of the positive things even for a moment, I actually have control over one of the things thats contributed to life being unbearable. 

but now I’m realizing if baby me had healthy food options and someone to explain nutrition, it wouldnt have been as unbearable. to what extent, I don’t know. its too depressing to imagine. 

anyway the point is, pls prioritize your personal nutrition. I’ve tried so many things my entire life to feel okay, but without the components it needs, your brain just cant do very well. I tried to eat as healthy as possible as I got older, but even the seemingly healthy options I had available to me still left me very deficient. 

(obviously malnutrition isnt the only thing that causes depression, but it has a huge effect. a lot of foods are marketed to seem healthy even if the producer is cutting every possible corner to make as much money as cheaply as possible. with how prominent that is, you should look closely at the actual amounts of nutrition in the things you eat and drink)",I’ve recently been getting closer to reaching proper nutrition everyday and it’s made more of an improvement than any antidepressant I’ve ever been put on has,1

Oh and also, this is not the first time this happened. I ALWAYS do this whenever I have a deadline coming up. always leaving things till the very last minute and always ending up doing a shitty job because of that. 

now, my problem with life isn't really about my inability to submit assignments on time, it is more about how fucked up I am as a person. whenever I fail to perform any form of task normally, I would get drowned in thoughts wondering why I am the way I am.

all I do is cry myself to sleep, stress eat and procrastinate. like that's literally my cycle of life.

I just realized I unconsciously think about this all the time in the sense that I live each day like it’s almost the last in a resigned manner. Almost as if I know an impending vacation is coming.. like any day coming up I’m prepared to be gone. strange to describe and put into words but let me give an example. I always make sure to have enough money to cover any debts, remaining rent, and cost of funerals, etc. I’m not even that old (19) and don’t own many things - I never shop for wants only needs - but this has been ingrained in my mind somehow. I wake up each day and think if I got in a car accident what things I would need to make sure is taken care of, like what things in the fridge would rot, whether the trash is taken out, whether I need to vacuum soon or if there’s dirty laundry. I just don’t want anything regarding me and my life to be an inconvenience or troublesome for anyone else after I’ve passed. I always make sure to be on good terms with people after a conversation, i.e. never leave an argumentative interaction with someone unresolved. My things are all boxed up and very easy to just be thrown away when the time comes. Don’t really keep extra things that need sorting or memorabilia/souvenirs, only the necessities. Even grocery shopping I really only buy enough to eat to survive. I’ve really distanced myself from my relationships so there’s not really many people that would even notice I’m gone.

I’m passed the point of active ideation but always wish I was and will be gone soon. All these social media posts talking about how there’s all these things more to experience or wish for don’t mean shit to me anymore. I literally don’t care and have no regrets. No regrets as in I have accepted the fact that I won’t experience them and I’m ok with that. Or regarding “good” experiences in life - like sunsets or whatever else - I’m of the perspective - I’ve experienced that, nice. But worth staying? Nah.

I see that now. I was hoping someone would not come and fix everything for me but that they would care. I tried it all, I tried caring so that maybe someone would too. I tried not to expect anything back and I did that but when things got rough and I cried for help, no one was there. People would only take from me, and now that I’m kind of empty, with nothing left to give, no one’s there.

But only kind of. It’s not so bad that I can’t see a light at the end or that I’ll never smile again. It’s that I’ll probably never get the only thing I ever craved for. That’s terrible actually but I don’t know, shit has a way of always getting worse than it is.

While that undoubtedly sucks, life is about more than that for me. I’m not down 24/7, thank the Lord, so I can’t act like my life is over. Get me not wrong, sometimes it stings really awfully and for long periods too. But there’s an entire world out there beyond my own personal lil one that is fascinating, to use one word to describe life.

I should go back in my head. It was always great every time, I would be my own patter in the back and it worked, it works, because I never let myself down in the sense that I always care.

And it’s not like I want to be babied around either. May not seem like it but I’m a strong person inside, I don’t go down easy and every time I do I never stay there longer than necessary. But even the strongest need a helping hand every now and then and I’ve never had that, not genuinely.

Now is one of those times. And what I needed now isn’t even that big a deal. Just someone who would listen and understand. You’d think that wouldn’t be so hard to find.

Anyway. C’est la vie, cheries. I want to go back and fix myself by myself like I’ve always done but not come back this time. It was only when I came back and hoped that I got bit in the ass. Every single time. But no longer.

I’m smart enough to understand and to move on and to focus elsewhere and to do so many other things this world has to offer that fulfill me. One of the best lessons I learned in life was how to take the L. Accept it, let it go and carry on.

To be in a relationship early on in my life was never negotiable thing for me. I have lost interest in literally everything I used to find enjoyable. Tv shows, Gaming, Connecting with friends , you name it. I also stopped having conversations with my parents. 

The only thing as of recently I,ve been doing, Is take a shit load of courses/credit hours and spend 90% of my time just focusing, planing, and revising how I could be done with this with least time possible. I’m CE Major, and I,ve been powering through it all. But , I,ve been also worried how being In this state for too long would affect me in the future. 

My routine is study, sleep, eat, occasionally go to the gym. But that’s it. I barely connect and talk with anyone.",Need some advice,1
289,"i'm near 30 and never had a girlfriend, last week a girl kissed me and the next day all my depression went away. I had energy again to clean the house, i felt that my spirit is smiling and the world is not a scary place anymore. the girl didn't wanna have a second date so the depression came back after the feeling of the kiss is over and now i feel like my soul is a zombie suffocating and trying to grasp some air to continue breathing and stay floating in this universe for a while longer.",i'm depressed because i'm single,1
290,"I don’t have the worst depression room but I let clutter, especially clothes build up on the desks and floor. I also struggle a lot with things like regularly changing out my sheets and blankets which definitely didn’t help. A couple days ago I saw a little bug crawling on my blanket. The last few days I’ve been finding more of them- another one on my bed, a few on my walls, my windowsill, in my closet, on the floor. I’ve been hypervigilantly looking for them at this point and changed all my bedding as well as finally washing some clothes but I think the damage is done. 

Because of the clutter, my room is filled with dust, especially in a few specific places, and I’m fucking terrified of what I could find there, especially under my furniture. But obviously I must already have an infestation. I’m scared to do ANYTHING in my room now because I know I’ll find more. My clothes that I couldn’t fit in the first wash round is still on the floor and I’m terrified to touch it because I feel like it’s crawling with bugs. 

I’m also guessing they’ve been there for way longer than I realize, so I don’t even know how long bugs have literally been crawling around in my bed with me. I was waiting for the day my room would get bugs and I’m guessing it happened recently because my parents stopped being on me much about cleaning my room after I turned 18. 

I’m planning to just suck up the shame and ask my dad to help me look and deal with the disappointment but I have to wait a week for him to come back from a trip. In the meantime I have no idea what to do because I feel like they’ll keep multiplying. Even starting to think about vacuuming and deep cleaning is overwhelming. Where do I even start????

292,"This may turn into a ramble and be somewhat disjointed so apologies in advance.

I'm a 21 year old guy from the UK and I've been planning and thinking of ways to end my life since the start of the year. I've been in a dark place for as long as I can remember, never seeing a point to life when we just die in the end, been bullied since year 3 of Primary school all the way until I finished my GCSEs. From the start of 2023 I've hit the lowest I think I ever have, with little to no care for life anymore and just wishing I was dead. I've planned the typical things like hangings, thought of the overdose routes, dangerous driving, whatever I have access to I've considered what ways I could kill myself with them.

As far as life goes I never really saw a point to it if death is just going to be the inevitable end, so why not just make it sooner? 

I cut off contact with all but 3 of my friends from secondary school shortly after finishing GCSEs, 1 of which died last year, 1 was my ex (we remained good friends, had some rough patches though) who just up and blocked me midway through last year with no explanation as to why, and the last I don't talk to all that much. I am quite an angry person from all of the bullying I've endured and most of the outbursts are often me exclaiming ""I just want to KMS/die"" and everything in relation. I have an online friend group who has often heard my outbursts but they take no notice and seemingly don't care.

I was at college until 2020 when I completed my course, but of course COVID happened and my future plans were all thrown out the window. So I've mostly just tried to cope with that and find jobs to act as a stop-gap until I can find an opportunity in the field I want to be in, but I've lost all motivation and care for finding it.

I always see the things of ""do something that makes you happy"" or ""find someone who will listen to you"" or whatever other bullshit people say to make you reconsider killing yourself, but none of them are useful. If anything they make me want to do it more. At this point in my life I'm nothing but a burden and a mental weight on those around me, I'm in this dark pit and quite frankly don't have the care anymore to try and get out of it since I always seem to end up back here but falling further in every time. I can't live through another cycle of this process.

I'm done, and I think it's time I start preparing and fulfilling some of those plans I've made.","I don't care to live anymore, and I haven't seen a point to it for a long time",1

299,"Hi. I’m a 14 year old freshman. Recently I’ve been sleeping in a lot to the point I don’t set an alarm because someone will always wake me up. Some nights I skip brushing my already disgusting teeth because I don’t have the energy for it. School has just been boring and sucky lately. A few times I get stressed or upset or don’t do good at something I seriously start thinking about whether I have a use in life or whether it’s worth it to continue living. These thoughts always go away once I’m in a better mood. Lastly, free time is never fun anymore. I’ll blank out and stuff or just not be able to relax.

The only time I can relax is with my school friends or with my online friend. Or in bed making up stories in my head. But my online one is only available like once a day for a few minutes.

301,"Every moment before it’s present. Every thought before it’s thunk. Every emotion before it’s felt. Every plan before it’s made. Every goal before it’s met. It even consumes itself. It mostly consumes itself. Feeding off of itself yet never failing to sustain.

It’s a cloud of rain reminding you that it’s ready to pour if at any moment you decide to enjoy the sun. Some days are all rain. Some days the cloud just lingers, never letting you forget that it’s there. It’s always present. It refuses to be ignored.

It reminds you to stay locked inside so that you never end up getting caught in the rain again. It reminds you not to make plans so that you won’t become disappointed when the rain washes them away. It reminds you to be content in your small space and to be thankful that you’re protected by the safety of four walls and a roof.

It’s suffocating but it’s safe. It’s confined but it’s familiar. There’s no room for growth but at least you’ll never get lost.

At first, people in your life may offer you an umbrella. But you know the umbrella can never guarantee you’ll stay dry. Even when locked away inside- the rain will at times find it’s way to you. Staying inside is the best way to minimize your risk. The rain is too much.

You can’t be disappointed by the things you never achieved if you never sought to achieve anything to begin with. You won’t have to blame yourself for being subjected to the rain if you don’t step out from under the protection of your small roof. If from time to time the rain still manages to make its way in- you can at least take comfort in knowing it was unavoidable, as you did everything you could to avoid doing anything at all.

It multiplies. The more you think about the rain, the more clouds appear. But again, it will not be ignored. The multiplying is inevitable. The more you dread the rain, the more rain comes. The more rain comes, the more you dread the rain. It’s a never ending cycle. It multiplies itself until there’s no longer room for anything but rain clouds and one day you’ll forget there was ever anything but.

It washes away everything that once was, everything that is and everything that will be. Every moment before it’s present, every plan before it’s made, every emotion that wasn’t born from the rain and every goal before it can be met. Serving as a constant reminder to stop expecting more than rain. Eventually you won’t even remember the sun, which in a way may makes the loss of it easier to bare.

But while it cleanses your tiny world of everything that can be seen, heard, felt or thought- it never washes away itself.

It’s always present. It’s impossible to ignore. You have become the rain.

i'm homeless because my mom believes she doesn't need a job because the king/prince of dubai is her soulmate and she'll be a millionaire soon ?????? i can't get a job either because she moves onto the next location every time i mention it. we hop from campground to couch to car to hotel and it's been this way for 6 years but her psych has deteriorated over time

barely made it through high school. i still haven't taken my 11th grade exam even though it's due soon. i haven't actually studied in years because i've had too much shit going on to focus. i did online school from 6th grade to 9th grade and have been fully homeschooled since. my brain's turned to mush. i failed every subject besides science and history so now my grades are too low to get into college. i also can't attend college because it's too much money. we literally have like 60 dollars in the bank bc someone lended it to us but it's gonna be gone soon cause my mom blows it on shit we don't need

i don't have any friends. or have anyone to talk to for that matter. i've never had an irl friend and it's been a year since i had an online friend. she has really strict rules around socialization and going outside. i'm watched like a hawk. i don't go outside unless my mom is right by my side but my dilemma is that i genuinely hate being around her because she's obnoxious and rude to everyone, but it's also my only opportunity to be part of the world instead of rotting alone inside all day. not like i get the chance to very often because she's lazy af and doesn't even like going on walks or going inside stores. she just orders things. the most i'll go outside is to walk to the bathroom across from our cabin or walk out to the car 

i'm always bored and lonely, have been my whole life basically, and it's resulted in me being completely apathetic towards everything. it's agonizing to say the least. i always feel empty and disconnected from my body and the world. the only thing that makes me feel good is maladaptive daydreaming but it's not reality. each time i accept that it's not reality i spiral further down and it feels like my head is physically ripping apart

my mom does so much more shit i won't even get into

cps is shit. cops are shit. both have done nothing but ridicule me. ruled my case as lies somehow. they shattered the only spirit i had left thinking that things would get better. nobody cares. i had one relative i could turn to and they said they'd arrest both him and me if i tried to stay with him 

i can't just leave because i don't have any resources, nowhere to stay, no money, no direction, etc and i'll probably get arrested this time

314,"I'm 32M and have been dealing non-fixable problems for a long time. I've seen that extended family is pretty much an arseholes and there's a tipping point where my life changed because of that.

* At the end of Uni i realised one thing; i feel like i picked a wrong subject. That's the time that i realised that working in IT back in my birth country, i won't achieve anything or can afford anything by myself.  
At the same time, i realised and considered my existence in this life. I feel nobody could hear my voice, nobody cares, and so on.
* Graduated, i ended up couldn't find a job for years. Literally years.  
I had only two jobs: one for 6 months and another for 1 month. I never and even up until today, feel proud that i worked there. I feel like it's just necessity to do something for money/living.  
That's from i graduated in 2012/2013 to 2018.  
Years of sending CVs and interviews, none of them stick around.
* During that 5-6 years, another major event happened to me and my parents.  
I realised that working in family is a BIG RED WARNING because how they can treat you bad since you're ""Family"". That's what happened to my dad.  
He lost his job because he and my mom tried to give a reasonable opinion towards my Uncle's son; their nephew.  
Huge debate and my parents ended up losing the job. That moment is a tipping point for me.  
I had huge anxiety issue and major depression. I went deep down the rabbit hole and i have no point of living anymore
* Until i got an opportunity to move country by myself for study and got a job in IT industry.  
For a slight moment, i feel better in my life but it went and still goes back to my depression

&amp;#x200B;

From here, this is the present problem that i have:

* Due to losing a job from his brother and being an older people (in my country), my dad doesn't have any income at all. I have to ""support"" them just for the sake being ""a son should help their parents' or anything about ""Family should support each other""
* Due to my depression, i got a suggestion from counsellor that helping people might help me slowly. Oh boy it's a very very wrong advice.  
I ended up losing lots and lots of money helping someone just to get on their feet and still didn't help.
* I can't even afford to rent place. House pricing is ridiculous, that includes living cost crisis that happened anywhere around the world.  
Having flatmates is a nightmare. I even tried to sacrifice what i do regularly so they can have things they want like quieter place, have their freedom, etc.

But all of them back to the reason why i created this post:

I'm tired living like this. This issue never ends and the only solution is pretty much having enough or lots of money.   
People just don't care what i've been through and nobody wants to help me as well.  
Family, friends, all of them are just arseholes.

Sometimes i wish they're gone. Like literally gone or die.  
My parents and everybody else in this world.  
If it doesn't allow, i just wish i'm dead. Never wake up anymore in the morning.  
I already wish the same thing every night. I feel done and i'm actually done both physically and mentally.  
Stress, feeling sick all the time, i sleep through the weekend and still feeling tired, i have no friends and nobody, Losing money means i have money problem as well, and nothing's good anymore in my life.

Basically don’t choose someone who didn’t choose you. If they’re fine without you in their life, then never take them back when they come back. People who are OK with you not being in their lives are not worth your mental well-being. 

In the past when I had read these, I never really understood them. I do now. 
As hard as it is for me to accept, because to accept it means it’s real. They never cared. They left. They’re gone.  Forever. They never coming back. They never wanted to. 

I’m their now. It’s been a long road. A painful journey. One that I’ll never repeat again in my life….ever!!! it isn’t over yet. And by that I mean the outcome of me.  I know I will not be that same I was before I met my ex person. 

      I don’t know if I’ll have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore. I don’t even know if I’ll have the motivating desire to want a better in life that I had when met my ex. Large part of me went silent. You could even see a large part of my died. The part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life..
I didn’t have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood.  

  

   I listened, eagerly to her stories. I told her mine. I did whatever I could to make her dailies a little easier. To give her a reason to smile. If it was sending her dinners, a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy, or just telling her a joke..(mostly bad ones🫣)
I tried my best to show my person I loved her. 

To me she was the world, my tomorrow’s, my happy, my love, my life, MY ONE…

But to her, I was no one special. In her own words, “there was nothing special about me”.

She took the best parts. She got better. She had options. She chose. She didn’t choose me. I was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from. That was what I was to her. That was my value to her. 

I have finally excepted this. I can’t lie to myself anymore. She chooses not to be in my life, and she chooses to ghost. I don’t know what tomorrow will hold. But I know I don’t want to see it. The pain within me only increases. They say with time things get better. For me it seems to be the opposite. I’ve always been different. Maybe that is my curse. I’m not like the crowd. Doesn’t seem to be a good thing for me, more like a curse.

I have adhd, many forms of anxiety, depression (obviously lol) and a slew of other mental disorders. I failed every class last semester mostly because I had a rough break up, and I thought at the beginning of the semester I’d do better. Which in a way I sorta did I’ve been taking more notes and stuff, but I’ve really been working on myself as a person more, and for a while a lot of my anxiety symptoms have been going away, but today I had a talk with my parents where they mentioned how I’d need to show them my grades and boom all of a sudden I’m back in my shitty little hole of overthinking. And yet again it looks like I might fail. I feel that college isn’t for me, but if I do t do college then what will I do for work I don’t wana live with my parents again, they are great but I need my space. I feel that I can’t be happy and get good grades, I don’t want to be who I am anymore I see a version of myself that I can be proud of but I need to work more towards it and I can’t do that and keep going to school because it’s too expensive. And socializing is hard enough for me so if I’m not on campus with people of similar age to me how will o ever find a person I want to spend my life with. I really dislike online dating but I’m worried that’s the only what I’ll find someone if I leave here I’m a hopeless romantic and I want to find someone in real life, like a meet cute or whatever they are called. Not to mention that I feel like a huge disappointment because no line of work really speaks to me, I want a job I’ll be happy in and will allow me to like a comfortable life.

369,"I (27M) had a horrible breakup 4 years ago and since then I've dealt with depression, suicidal thoughts, and very low self-esteem. I've been seeing progress in my mental state and I'd say I'm doing much better than the years since and have better coping mechanisms for my negative thoughts.

  
However, there are some insecurities that are still with me. I've just met someone wonderful about 4 years younger than myself but I can't seem to properly love/trust/feel secure with this person. When she talks about traveling with her friends, I get turned off. It's like I only want her with me. I feel a sense of abandonment. Also, I don't have any close friends like hers or I don't think I do. My ex called me a loner when we broke up and that's stuck with me.  
When this new girl talks of her successes I feel like shit again and get turned off. I want to be the Alpha, I want to be successful and take care of her. I get attracted to broken people , maybe because I'm broken. I don't know if it's fair to her if I continue this relationship. I want a relationship but it seems that I'm not ready.

386,"Hi everyone, M25 here

I'm currently living in Lebanon where we have been suffering from a very bad economic crisis. Our currency has been devaluating at a rate where the prices go up every day.
Due to that crisis, most people my age have been immigrating and looking for jobs abroad.

I am currently getting paid a livable wage, can't complain there. I can go out to restaurants, and pubs and do activities when the majority of people can't. Note that my salary isn't considered high, I have friends who earn double and triple my income.

I majored in business administration so finding a job abroad, unlike my engineer friends, is next to impossible.

I am tired. Tired of living each day the same as yesterday. Tired to see more of my friends leaving. Tired of being alone. I'm stuck in a mental loop. Most of my friends are living their life, travelling with each other, and making memories while I'm stuck here.

I am very close to the girl I like, but she doesn't know, and seeing her miles away from me is heartbreaking. I can't make a movie knowing it will be agonizing for us to start a relationship long-term while being in my current state. Knowing she is out there spending time with our friends, making memories with them when I can't be there is crushing me more.

I was heavily depressed for several years when I was younger and managed to overcome it and be happy for a while. It seems like the depression is creeping up again.

I used to be a blanket without seams, a silk cocoon of happy dreams. Now I'm a quilt, no square the same, a patchwork of pleasure and pain.

I feel useless. Each breath I take is meaningless. Breathing is not living. I want to live. I want to be happy.

I am not suicidal. I want to overcome it. But death wouldn't be so bad right now.",Tired,1

388,"I'm a bit of an introvert but through the years I learned to appear social and outgoing with people. In most contexts it's positive and useful. But in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person. 

I sometimes make jokes about memes, funny videos, etc. It's a good way to engage with other people at work for example. Rest of the people do the same. It's not that I'm joking more than the rest of the people. 

I never make jokes about the others, I'm very respectful. I even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people. 

Yet there's always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me. For example, now people at work make fun about my poor diet. I never detailed anything about what I eat, or if I had time to cook. And some of those people bring canned food. Or about some of my habits. When stuff like this starts happening, I feel really hurt. It's like I thought for a long time I was sharing funny moments with workmates, and actually everybody was clowning me. 

There are some ridiculous things about me. My voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age (37) and that would be a main thing. I'm gay and that makes it even more obvious, but I don't talk about my sexuality since it's private. 

I wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually I'm being friendly like the others. 

However I no longer care. Once I get fed up with all this, I avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me. I would consider to say what I wrote here in a polite way, but it's impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person. 

 So I've decided to not eat again with this people, just go outside or stay on my own. Not the first time it happens to me, but the first where i can just avoid it easily.

393,"I had gone through a lot in the past 2 years, facing a horrible dispute with my parents (mom,stepdad,and dad) and being thrown into a mental hospital after a school got scared of me. My parents destroyed my relationship with my ex and my social life, making me mentally snap or something. Afterwards, then figuring my dad had manipulated me and ridding of him from my life. I took lots of drugs I wasn’t supposed to take after everything that had happened and nothing afterwards has been the same. 

I had realized I no longer was happy about the things that made me happy, rather emotionless. This occurred after me getting out of the mental hospital , furthering getting worse after a cycle of rad-140 with mk677 and a Benadryl overdose of 1200mg in the span of two days. I have a new relationship, life, no more problems it seems like, but I feel no joy and no happiness towards my daily actions and accomplishments as well as interactions with other people. I go through my day seeing my current girlfriend and  friends or getting something done but never feel completed, like I did something but forgot cause I just did it to do something. I also recognized how much I had dissociated, it felt like all I think about is the wrong and past because it’s what I can’t fix that was clearly my fault at some times. I think too much about what people have done to me, making me stay away and never invite people over. I often blur out and feel as if I’m in my own world where nothing exist for seconds up to hours, even sometimes forgetting who was talking to me or what I was doing.

I feel insane, I have extremely bad mood swings. No I never was diagnosed with any sort of mood disorder, but I was on abilify because of alleged homicidal ideations. I have extreme anger, enough to cause myself and others harm. I do not have any explanation to why I have these feelings and want an explanation. I have cut myself before because of the anger towards myself and others and don’t want to be in the same place. I have had unexplained episodes before that felt descriptive to being manic episodes but never fully closed to be, just because they said it was the mood stabilizers that caused it. The last time I felt homicidal ideations was unintentional and was two weeks ago.

I started to stop caring about everything. Problems I had, my grades, my girlfriend, my ex, my goldfish and my dog it didn’t matter. Every problem was the same because I felt as if nothing could feel as close as painful as the things I heard and saw from the past 2 years specially and even further in the past with trauma. I would be in near death situations even with drugs with almost dying from multiple overdoses, with the worst being Benadryl. I miraculously have woken up every time just glad I had experienced something out of worldly and disconnected more than actually caring that I almost died. The Benadryl overdose itself, actually made this affect worse. After two weeks and a half of recovery from it, I felt so disassociated and had no feelings towards anything in a bad or negative way similar to what I was talking about earlier but worse, making me stop caring about everything. Somewhat it wasn’t the worst, considering the days that would viewed the worst by others was just another day for me just like the rest.

Random thoughts of apologizing, being empathetic, but then being hateful and sad and homicidal. Also sort of like mood swings, it’s just an array of unexplained thoughts that never get told to the people I’m thinking about or anyone actually. And example of this goes as such, I will feel happy I had feelings towards someone and remember what they’ve done but then feel extreme opposite feeling such as pain,anger,fear,sadness, and homicidal ideations. I had these feelings and still do as they can happen anywhere, I’ve had them for years in-fact. Do they mean anything?

I am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed write-up of my life and issues soon. I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. Sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better.

My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.

And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.

My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen.

I never found a purpose in life, nothing that makes me truly happy, all I really do is sit all day and play videogames, pump my body with caffeine and sugar and hope for brighter days to come, even though I know they wont or that theres a small likelyhood of it happening.  
Every day I consider more vile ways to commit suicide, which is something I havent considered at all just a year prior. My mother calls my reasons for lack of happiness stupid and I havent been offered any comforting words, like ever.

Well she did go to the doctors maybe 7 years ago and got a few counselling sessions but never went back. She can be fine for over a year and then something switches in her and she just shuts off. This recent episode has been since last Tuesday and she is pushing me away. We have a day off planned tomorrow and she is telling me to go into work. She sits up on her own drinking and listening to music.  She says things have changed between us yet only a few weeks ago we were immensely happy and texting each other how much we love each other.  Yet she is saying we don't do anything and sit in silence. I know this isn't true. We go on lots of walks together, we stayed overnight in a hotel and had a theatre trip at the beginning of the month. I have been away with work for a few days and had a holiday with friends this month too.
She usually loves to make plans but is showing no interest in anything.  She also is quite on top with the house and is not really doing anything other than getting by.

She has issues with her mum (who has treated her appallingly throughout her life) and they are currently not speaking and she lost a close family member 6 months ago so I know things are getting on top of her.

I'm petrified that she is going to end the relationship but I am trying to hide this and stay my usual upbeat self. I've told her I'll stick by her in whatever she needs.  She won't see a doctor or consider a therapist and I just don't know what to do.  She isn't very good at vocalising her emotions and just says she wishes she could have a break from her life for a month.

I suppose I'm looking for answers from people who have felt like this or had partners similar to this so I can figure out if she is just falling out of love with me or is this depression and we will recover.

I could be the person that lights up a room. Sorry to toot my own horn. I have always, however, had health anxiety. Worried about this and that, many medical tests, etc.

Over the last year, other than the 2 months I was on Zyprexa (which I guess should be very telling) I am exhausted beyond belief. I am crying all the time.  I almost never feel well-rested. I want to sleep all day. But even when I try to nap I rarely fall asleep. I just lie there and remain exhausted. Physically so exhausted. Last year I had a stupid pulmonologist (sometimes they dabble in ""sleep medicine)  suggest to me that I had narcolepsy. As a person with health anxiety, this was terrifying. I got 3-4 separate medical opinions, ALL of them from major Universities. They all said I didn't even close to have narcolepsy, and that It was my depression causing it. My tests (overnight sleep study and daytime nap study) weren't close.  I didn't believe them. I was in denial. **I think because I used to have times when I felt great and the depression lifted, this had to be something different.**

However, if I try to look at things objectively I have to see that in the last year, I have become a caretaker for my mother with ALS who is rapidly progressing, I have become more isolated and hang out with friends less, and haven't been working on my passion (music) as much.

I'm still a kid who never grew up. I'm immature. I'm not smart. I'm not capable of great things. I've wasted too much time thinking about useless things like what the future may hold and what purpose I have in this world. This reality truly is tiring. 

I still don't believe this reality is for me. I'm not fine. I've not been fine this whole time, even though I've been doing my best to get through it all. I still see suicide as my only way out and still struggle with ideation, fearing that I won't be able to integrate into society like a normal person. I'm still afraid to go through with suicide, even though I'm physically hurting almost every day from living, and I don't think I'll ever be able to go through with suicide because of that fear. I will forever be trapped here until I die from natural causes or an accident.

It's become more difficult to live, and I expect it to be even more difficult as time moves on. I find it hard to get out of bed until hours later where I feel regretful for staying in bed for too long. I don't have the motivation or strength to do things that would benefit me, like showering consistently, cleaning, or eating meals. I can't even push myself to find work. I feel bad for telling people this stuff, and I don't trust any professionals with this either. I want to improve, but I lose motivation easily. I don't have anyone or a support group to keep me on my feet. I can't do this by myself. I don't know what to do next to make things better for myself.",Reflecting on where I was five years ago to now,1

I am stuck in a never ending cycle of anxiety and sadness. Alcohol, in the rare times I’ve used it, calms me down. It makes the anxiety surrounding my circumstances dissipate.  I don’t see how making drinking a habit will worsen my life. Usually alcohol ruins your relationships, but I already don’t leave the house or have much human contact. It stops you from solving your problems, but I already am doing nothing about them. It poisons your body physically but I don’t care about my physical health.

He's currently renting and moving to an apartment in Gloucester Massachusetts with his other family members for us to live in, I bought a mattress and a bed frame on amazon and shipped it to his address there, today I asked him if he could take another picture of my mattress since it arrived a few days earlier and he blew up at me, asking me why I don't trust him because my bed is already there and telling me I shouldn't disrespect him.

I'm kinda desperate as well cuz I said that I was going to kill myself to a suicide hotline person out of anger lol, although it's a good thing I used a fake name, but if they arrive to my house and figure out it's me they'll throw me in a psych ward again, instead of the person who ruined my life, I don't want know if I want to go to Massachusetts anymore, I just can't take any of this seriously anymore.

Plus medication in general tastes horrible or the pills are huge and get stuck in my throat and just hurt going down in general, so I almost prefer to forget.

And the longer I put off refilling the meds is more time my body is without the meds, and whatever effects they might've been having are never able to reach their full potential. And for the short time that I take these meds, I don't see much change, in terms of helping or even side effects. They may as well be placebo. And since I get no benefit in the short term, it makes it hard to stick with in the long term. I'm not motivated enough to keep taking them.

then last night i did something incredibly stupid. We had been talking pretty much non stop on snap ever since and she goes to a local pub with her friends and stops replying to me (fair enough, she can have fun) then sends me a snap saying shes going to some friends house and half an hour later another snap of her extremely drunk on the toilet saying ""im fucked"" and i immediately start to worry. I ask if she is ok, if she is safe and has people with her and she doesnt reply. I try to call 4 times with no answer then 5 minutes later she sends a very inaudable snap that i dont even know what she was saying, almost spitting saliva everywhere and my worry gets worse....

463,"  Hello! Today, I (18M) fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being, unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering, not brushing my teeth, not shaving, not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and ""normal"".

  
 I recently started college, I've been making friends and generally having a great time, this, if u look at it from the outside. 

  
 Inside my head, I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically, because of my clothes, my face, my hair, because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving, because somehow I smell bad, etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads (And don't let me start with my personality), basically all this converts into me having a sort of ""Double life"".

  
When I need to go outside, I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice, smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home, my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side, I don't take care of myself in any way type or form, suddenly I am mean, lazy, antisocial and want to die once again.

466,"When I was 18, I had moved out because I has a strained relationship with my family. I moved away because I wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired. I ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south, halfway across the country, at my father's suggestion for an easier life while I worked and got my degree. And the distance did exactly what I wanted: it showed my parents that I was strong and capable and mature and that I was an adult. But it also created a great longing for home. 

Life was easier. I got a better job, I bought a house, and I live comfortably with my husband. But... We don't like it here. We like the small city, the restaurants, the proximity, the healthcare, etc. But the environment and climate do not align with us. We are northerners at heart. We like the seasons, fall and winter, the hills, the mountains, the streams winding through the forest. We miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes. 

But I also miss my family. I miss my parents, my brother, my nephew. I miss my childhood best friend and her family. I am heartbroken seeing years pass and I am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine. I am just incredibly lonely here, and I want to be with them. 

There has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back, but the biggest one being how expensive it is there, and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our well-playing fields. So years pass by and we stay here, while wishing we there. 

Well now my parents are getting older, approaching their 60s. They want to retire, but they don't want to retire there, they want to retire in the state I'm currently in. 

So then, becomes a new dilemma: do I stay in this state that doesn't make me happy, so I can be with my parents (and potentially my brother in time)? Do I move back home and enjoy my brother's company for as long as I have it, I have my friends, my climate, and my job? Either way I'm giving up something that feels non-negotiable for my complete happiness. 

I'm overcome with this intense sadness that I've spent all the years where I could have had it all being away. And now they are gone and I feel as if the life I have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone. 

Ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that I know they love and enjoy and that we do as well, and they don't budge - this is their plan. I feel selfish when I push too hard.

I never thought i would make it past 16 honestly and im even more surprised that I haven’t gotten to courage to attempt to end myself again.

I  am just so tired of all of this, All the things that I used to love means literally nothing to me, I keep getting overwhelmed by everything at the middle of the semester, I keep self sabotaging so bad that i just lay in bed all day or do nothing productive at all. Ive never seen myself in a future where I could be happy with the others and Ive lost all my hopes and dreams. Over the years i have developed the worse eating habits as well as letting my negative self talk become louder and louder to the point when sometimes when I wake up, Im already defeated by it so I see no point in getting out of bed or do anything at all. Why even bother if it’s pointless anyway.

I dont even get why I am becoming like this. I barely understand how I feel, how think or what the hell I am even doing.
I thought I could prove my thoughts wrong by proving that I could do stuff but Im coming close and closer to accomplishing another self fulfilling prophecy each time, thinking about death being the only way out of this since its the only way to stop existing.

Although I think this is true I know deep down that its also a lie. I envy those who can just wake up, go through life and enjoy it. Idk how they do it but I wish I could experience it. Just being alive for once, being human without ruining everything that I do. I want to be able to convey emotions again, cry instead of blocking all of this sadness in my throat without having to bottle everything up until I breakdown, be angery at stuff due to how wrong some of them are, be happy and have way more better days than what I am having rn and laugh at how everything is just absurd with other people. I dont want to stay as this subhuman filth that I have become but every step I take takes me to nowhere so I am just here, standing still while watching everything else moving forward.",I wish I wasn’t like this,1
468,"I have a situation that I won’t go too much detail, but I’ll probably write a lot about it

My gf/now ex ended things last weekend because of her severe depression after she was crying about everything and didn’t want to put me through it. She told me she always pushes everyone away. She lost her two year old boy three years ago and never got help to grieve. We also found she miscarried just before the weekend too, however before this she told me she was not wanting the baby.

The day after this happened I shut myself off from my phone and apparently she tried to contact me, raced around to my apartment and was shaking giving me a big hug thinking i’d done something to myself (wasn’t my intention).

Since then I’ve felt down about it. I made it clear to her that I want her but I understand that isn’t important right now and her getting better is key, that I would stick by her no matter what. She appreciated this and said let’s see what the future holds but that she needs space between us. I agreed and respected this. She also said she still loves me.

She came over a couple of days ago and I was on the phone to customer service. When she spoke to them they asked who she was and she said “his partner” which confused me. She invited me to IKEA after I finished work so I could help her with buying stuff, we went and got some food and overall we had a laugh (like our earlier days).

I’m trying to give her space but she keeps contacting me about things in the apartment, etc. Her mum had asked me to reset some laptops for her but I was given no deadline and had been very busy lately.

My ex tried to call me multiple times this morning about the laptops but I was working. I called her on my break and she was very aggressive on the phone. I mentioned doing this as a favour but she called me an “inconsiderate c*nt” because of what her mum had done for me. She also complained at me that if it wasn’t for her nothing would have got done in our apartment and that she was in there today sorting stuff.

What originally caused her to leave our apartment and go back to her mums were these low moments she’d have lashing out because of her depression. My issue was i’d react to it, turn it into something more and walk out the room, so when she was being like this on the phone I wanted to be the opposite and tell her it’ll be okay and i’ll sort it. She spiralled into a meltdown with me and hung up.

I sent a message after saying it’ll be sorted tonight and i’ll drop the laptops off, that I do appreciate everything her and her mum have done.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like this is a further step back and she now hates me. She seemed to be warming back up to me when we were at IKEA. I still want to be there and support her when she needs me, but I feel like after this, depression aside.. why would she even want to consider making a go of things with someone she sees as “inconsiderate, dragging feet, etc”. ?

I plan to keep giving her space until she reaches out again, but I keep thinking that in the long term I’ve severed any chance of her returning. I want to show her I’m not like that, just I’ve had to juggle everything so I’m finding it difficult to complete jobs she wants alongside balancing my own life

I want to support her through her depression so much, I love her, but it just feels like she hates me right now","Depressed GF (f31) ended things with me (m30) to not put me through it, but I still want to support her.

476,"So, my prior job turned extremely toxic back in November due to new management. It devastated my (already shitty) mental health. In January I couldn’t take it anymore so I quit. I’m 42 years old and I have a mortgage and I live alone with my dog. There’s no money coming in and my house payment is 23 days late. 

I’ve tried getting a new job, but due to my depression, I can barely make myself go to the mailbox and get the mail more than once per week. I’ve only left my house once in the last 2 months. I’ve had 2 interviews lined up but I couldn’t make myself go. 

So, a couple weeks ago I had the idea to start a business. I failed to get any investors, so I said fuck it and started using my credit cards to buy the tools and equipment I need. 

I’m currently just about out of money, and I’m nowhere near ready to start the business. Making and selling things, basically is the business model. 

I’ve been really starting to feel the full weight of this decision and the pressure to not fail is insane. I don’t know what to do if I fail.

I’ve had plenty of suicidal thoughts since back in November, but I was able to push them away. My dog and my dad (he lives in another state and has health issues and he’s pushing 80) are the only things keeping me from swallowing the old bottle of ambien in my cupboard, pulling my car into the garage, and just letting it all go.

The part of me that wants to live is getting smaller everyday. I’ve discussed all this with my therapist and one friend, but even then I have a habit of sugar coating things. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel broken and empty inside. Out of nowhere I’ll just break down and cry. I can’t remember the last time I thought “hey maybe things are gonna be ok”.

Kids would also talk about me being overly sensitive and crying too much. But i was genuinely hurt. Nowadays whenever I’m sad or cry, those memories get in my head and i convince myself that I’m faking it; like my feelings aren’t genuine, like i am doing it for attention even if I am genuinely hurt. I feel like I can’t trust myself. I struggle with OCD, depression, and anxiety. I’m taking Buspar for anxiety, ashwaganda, and did some OCD therapy for about 2-3 months weekly. The OCD aspect somewhat improved. However, my depression has skyrocketed. I’ve always been able to make friends easily however it wasn’t because of my personality but the way I can match others energy. I Can get every guy to like me not because they like me but because I’m easy to talk to. I feel like I don’t even have an identity, a personality. I don’t feel like a person and therefore, don’t feel deserving of love or anything. I struggle with being insecure sometimes as well. In eighth grade, these boys who i thought were friends of mine came behind my chair and repeatedly called me ugly until I cried. That moment haunts me forever. Another moment, i love my mom to pieces but something she said killed me. I was a rotten girl growing up. Again, i was mad at the world. I felt no one understood me. I had a strict dad who is emotionally unavailable and a helicopter mom (not like this anymore we are best friends now). They again would always make incidents my fault for being too sensitive. One time I went too far with being a rotten preteen and my mom said you know I used to always dream of having a daughter and now that I have you this is not what I wanted. Along those lines.

I am writing this note with a heavy heart, seeking and begging for your forgiveness for my pathetic and weak existence. I am sorry for the pain and disappointment I may have caused you all through my cowardly acts and weak display of character.

My entire life has been a complete failure; I have been consumed by fear, self-doubt, and discouragement that it has rendered me powerless in almost all aspects of my life. I have tried so hard to fit in and be accepted, but it seems like no matter how much I try, my efforts are always not good enough.

I am sorry for all the times I let you down, for all the opportunities I squandered and wasted because I was too timid to seize the moment. I am sorry for all the people whose trust and love I lost because I could not face my shortcomings.

I know that taking my own life is not the solution, but I cannot bear the pain and the emptiness that I feel inside anymore. I cannot bear living in this world that expects too much from me when I clearly cannot deliver.

I hope that one day you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for my cowardice and inadequacy. I hope that you can move past my shortcomings and failures and remember me for the good that I once was.

To my family, friends and loved ones, I am sorry that I couldn't be the strong and dependable person that you deserved. I hope that my death brings you some form of closure and relief from the burden that I have become in your lives.

I will leave this world with a prayer in my heart that one day the world will be a better place where acceptance, kindness, and love abound, may nobody else ever feel the isolation and pain that I have felt during my life.

I hope that when I am gone, the world becomes brighter and filled with more hope and happiness. Goodbye, world. Please forgive me.

Also I am reasonably healthy - I need to work out for some stamina but I hardly have any overweight, don't smoke, don't drink, I eat healthy. Sounds great, right? 

I was burnt out in 2021 because I worked 24/7 for many years - and even though it feels like the burnout is mostly gone, I can't really get myself to do anything.. and it's starting to get to me - I am feeling frustrated about it more and more.

Honestly don't feel like I am depressed. I feel happy and mostly relaxed w/o anxiety. I am absolutely motivated to do a lot of things - both in the work and private spectrum.. maybe I even want to do too much stuff. I REALLY want to do all the things in my head and achieve new goals. But I sit on the couch and then when I want to start with something I just can't get myself to do it. And when I do, I don't finish it.

Examples are typically:

* I have some great online business ideas and I can start them all myself from my home office. I start the projects but I never finish.
* I have a great gym at home and I want to work out at least a few times a week, but I just don't do it.

Daily tasks are not an issue and I do them with pleasure - e.g. cooking, cleaning, administrative tasks, garden work, etc. It's not a problem at all. I am guessing because they are small isolated tasks that I can finish and then move on.

Anyway, I had intakes with a couple of therapists and they all say that they think I seem very good and not depressed, that I should do more fitness and are not sure they can help me any further. And even though they're right - I should get more fit - but I really doubt that's what is keeping me from actually doing/finishing things.

511,"Okay this may seem like a dumb question to a lot of you but just hear me out and please keep the judgement to a minimum. I'm sharing this because I genuinely want to change for the better after living like this for 20 years.

For a little background, I grew up in a household where my mother and I weren't on the best terms and all she did as I grew up was work occasionally and sleep in bed all day long. Microwave dinners were a regular thing for me and my brothers, I did pretty bad in school blah blah blah. The big thing was, I was never taught good hygiene as a kid. It was never required or encouraged enforced. I grew up and went through high school without showering regularly, doing assignments, or even engaging with many people outside of school because my mom didn't allow me to get out of the house much. I'd spend my time, playing games, reading, and a loooot of media. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a weird smelly kid in highschool (surprisingly with the whole shower thing. I didn't sweat or anything and always used deodorant and perfume clean clothes etc.) I had a lot of friends that I talked to daily up until senior year. My senior year was when Covid hit and everyone was in quarantine. When school started back up I never went because it was online. That same year I moved in with a new bf and his dad and uncle and since I was so accustomed to staying in a room all day without socializing or doing anything, that's what I did there. I dropped out of highschool and lived with my new boyfriend at the time for two years and to this I realized that I still never leave the room I stay in. Even when my bf has a job that requires him to travel for work, I stay in the hotel room still having horrible hygiene habits (although again not smelling bad or anything) and consuming lots of media from the bed. I'd have moments where come to the realization that l've spent days, weeks, then months doing the exact same thing and wasting the entire day away doing absolutely nothing. It's only dawned on me now that something could be wrong and I should hear other's opinions on it. Of course I'm using a throw away because sharing this is embarrassing enough. I've never considered myself depressed and honestly I never want to but every time Hook up what l'm dealing with su*cide and help websites pop up...

I don't know how to go about this and I genuinely want to do better, so if anyone knows some steps I can take to doing better, I'd really appreciate it.

This is a pretty ignorant question but is there a distinction between internally induced and externally induced depression?

For instance internally would be those cases where your neurochemicals just betray you, you're moving through life just fine then suddenly you're bedridden with catatonic depression and only after being heavily medicated can you function.

Externally would be a concatenation of failures or disappointments or miseries which blacken your view of humanity and existence itself to the point that you no longer see the good in people or the joy in experiences and eventually an reach a point where you're also dysfunctional and need to be medicated.

Dear Journal, 
  I got sick again. The same cyclical vomiting and upper stomach pain I had before. Yesterday and last night was the lworst of it. I'm just now starting to feel slightly better. 
  My biggest regret is how quickly I wanted to end my life. This wasnt a little pain by any means. The  last time this happened, I had a psychotic break in the hospital and tried to cut myself open. This time wasn't as severe or long but still, the pain got so bad I wanted to end it all. I even thought of how. But by some stroke of fate, I talked myself out of it. Citing mostly that I just wasn't ready.
  I spent the rest of the night repeating that it will pass. All storms pass, this will too. I know it sounds silly,but either by distracting myself or blind luck, I started to feel better.
I've always believed you gotta do what you gotta do. Last night, I had to survive and I did. I dont know how or even why I managed to talk myself out of it, but I am grateful. I can't say I'll always have that power. It didn't even sound like words I would say. I mean ""this will pass"", how cliché. But as the night passed and dawn broke, I knew I made it.

For context I was dating a girl for a while (when it started i was like 15 and she was 18 going on 19) and she was allways emotionally abusive in some form but it all went down hill my junior year when I was 17 she started drinking more often and mixing her meds with it. Long story short she ghosted for like 3 or 4 months and when she did contact me it was pretty much to say she's dumping me and moving to Florida with a  ""friend"" she met in college who I have on good report she was cheating on me with. I still haven't emotionally recovered from that mess every negative thing that happened to me has left me afraid of a repeat in my next relationship.

543,"I am also a very isolated person. I’m a first year teacher; tomorrow is my formal, which is one of the most important days of the year for my career. I get evaluated on my performance.

I’ve never missed a day of work until this month; I was so sick that I was sent to the ER. That was two weeks ago. Then I couldn’t chew, my wisdom teeth were gnawing at me, and the gum over the tooth got infected. Now I have a cold as well.

Within this time, I’ve lost my gold chain, an invaluable item with massive sentimental value. I received it from my parents when I graduated from my masters. I wore it everywhere.

I haven’t been sleeping. I’ve cut off the few friends I have entirely for weeks. My co-workers know something is off, but I put on a smile at work.

I am absolutely broken. I’ve had close to no sleep these past few days. I’ve found no enjoyment in anything and have had no appetite.

I haven’t been happy for years. I have isolated myself due to the pressures of work; and have lost a lot of friendships and relationships because of it. But these past few events have been stacking on and I don’t know if I can take this anymore. I have rigorously searched everywhere for this gold chain, but I think I’ve lost it at the gym or at the library on Monday. I’ve called both.

My thoughts are everywhere, I apologize if this is not comprehensible.

I’m been sad for months due to other things but it feels like I have a curse, or a bad omen following me this month. I don’t know what to do, or who to talk to. I can’t speak to my friends, it’s so embarrassing. My life feels like it’s been falling apart at a slow and steady pace and this is the huge finale.",I’ve recently lost an invaluable watch and gold chain that was passed down from my family. I’ve also been sick for a month.,1
544,"I have a violet schizophrenic/autistic brother who SA me and almost killed me multiple times during rage or psychotic episodes. 

During these episodes, he would get violet in public. In middle school he had attacked the school cop, grabbed his gun, and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky, the cop arrested him. After that, rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. 

Here is the thing: Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me, strangle me, stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. 

A few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head, one more hit and she would have been dead. Again, they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse, how I was scared for my life. 

They said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me. I became so stressed and scared my awful father tried to put me in a group home because I said I didn't want to live there. Yet, the person who caused my distressed and harm was living at home and not in the mental institution.

I spoke to my therapist about this. She said since I'm only in my early 20s I can still press criminal charges against him. I am broken. I want to press charges but my parents will shun me. My parents help me financial since I am unable to work because of my kidney and seizure disorder. I know they would leave me homeless or try to get back at me and charge me with a stupid crime. My father was able to lie to the police operator about my mom to have her arrested and institutionalized. 

I am terrified of my father, and my mom cares more about my brother than I. She knows he raped me and hurt me, but still demands I come to his birthday or she won't pay my rent. Also, he SA my mom multiple times while I was a teen. Yet, my mom says she stays with him for his money. She would tell me thus as a teen, which is so sick to involve a child when you are staying with him.

I want to charge him so badly. My parents lied to me when I was a teenager when I wanted to go to the police. They said that the police won't help me. Finding our that my family lied to me, knew about the abuse, and now several years later learning he could have been charged is destroying me. 

I want to press charges. I have no money for an attorney.

I'd lose everything, become homeless, my mom who is the only person I care about would never speak to me again. I am having horrible flashbacks. My therapist also stated that I should be ""proud"" that I havnt killed myself, since most others would have with what Ive been through. This is after she knew I had slit my throat at 18.

545,"I’m 16 (barely lived I know) yet sometimes I feel as if I’ve endured too much.

Even though this may sound like easy issues to some people, it really ruins me. Every night I cry and think about how terrible of a daughter or sister and student I must be or how retarded I am to be failing almost every class. Now the only thing I think about literally ending my own life because I just don’t care to exist anymore, even if I was doing good in school I’d just be on the road to living a typical boring life where I work at a job that I hate and suffer until I reach my death bed.

546,"First of all I don’t 100% believe in tarot reading. It usually just reads current energy but “future reading” is usually just for guidance and would change - afterall, our future ultimately depends on us and our actions.

I am not clinically diagnosed as having depression (because of lack of funds) but I had a test last year from our office and I scored a level 4 in terms of depression. I guess that’s the most one can get. I think I got that score because because I scored a yes in terms of harming. I never really thought of committing suicide but sometimes I think of what if somewhere some truck would just hit my car and I’d be in a car accident.

Going back to tarot reading. The reader never answered my question and it became a psychic read where in some spirit comes to talk to you. She asked about my dad… I said my dad had passed 15 years ago. She described how my dad is and telling me about my current situation, how I am carrying everything and I need someone to depend on and help me. This made me realize that as much as I have a close small group of friends, ones whom I trust - I really don’t have anyone that I can truly depend on 100%, like who can I ask money for should I get to an accident etc. none. My mom and my brother is there but I really don’t want them shouldering my problems. I also realized that I am not living for anyone… but why not live for myself? It’s just a problematic life and I honestly won’t mind if my life ends here. It made me realize those people with children having all the will to live because they need and have to…

If you see me out, it looks like I’m living such a good life. I look good, I dress well, on weekend I go to brunches. I watch musicals, opera, attend art galleries and eat good food. I smile and I laugh - but I also don’t have money and I live paycheck to paycheck with lots of debts. I need to have a thyroid operation which my healthcard cannot pay for fully, so I will need to line up on a public government hospital. 

Last year I have a colleague who I used to be friends with. We drifted apart because of work which is okay with me because you won’t be friends for life with all of your friends, some friendships has an expiration date. That’s just reality but it seems like groupings have happened at work and it’s really annoying sometimes. In my head, that’s okay and I’ll just work. The friend I have in the office also just got retrenched.

Something happened at work again today and as much as I say I dont care about it as long as I know I’m in the right then I don’t want to even think about it. But I cried and honestly, I just want to resign, lay in bed, look in the ceiling and have my thoughts run around.

549,"Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for a good 10 years now, with the worst dip taking place a year back. Im slowly starting to get better but lately something weird has started happening. 

The worst part of depression for me is the sadness that I cant seem to shake. It’s not the normal kind of sadness, rather the romantic/heartbroken sadness. 
I’ve not been in a relationship for a long time, and I’m not well enough to be in a relationship at the time. 
I still talk to girls like I used to, but in a much more restricted way.
One person recently wrote to me and we started talking (nothing intense or anything).
When that person doesnt answer or say something I could interpret as something negative through mental parkour,
My heart breaks, I get the biggest pit in my stomach and I get completely engulfed in the sorrow. 
This happened the very first day of us talking. 
I am not in love with this person, we dont really know eachother, nothing has happened, i dont even know if what we’re doing has any romantic side to it at all.

Most of the time I can understand why I feel the way I do, even if it’s mostly negative. But this anxiety-ridden pit in my stomach wont go away, and I cant reason with it.

So I guess the TLDR; 
I become unreasonably romantically attatched, after just a few words over text, which leads me to feel constantly heartbroken. 

Am I just lonely and I havnt realized it?",My feelings arent making sense anymore TLDR at bottom,1

he was so beautiful. he had such a beautiful soul. he was so unlike me. i was obsessed with him. we even dated for a while. i made his life a living hell. i never treated anyone in my life as poorly and callously as i treated him. im sure if he stayed with he would've died. honestly he probably would've killed himself. he ghosted me. not a day goes by i dont think of him. i wish i could go back and fix things. and never say a word to him. i miss his face. i miss his voice. i miss his hair so much. im sure those are all long gone. as he transitioned more and more of what i fell in love with would fade away. i can't even imagine what he looks like now.

its sad. the thing i miss most about him. is the way he tasted. what kind of human answer is that. im a monster. a devil. i would kiss him for hours. until his lips were bruised. i would take the anger i have for this life out on him. i could still hear him gasping for air. i look at my hands and wonder why. 

i've been depressed my entire life. it was cruel of me to spread it to him. he was an angel. and i set him on fire to keep me warm. im a walking black hole who tried to destroy him. but he survived. he has a pretty good life now it looks like, well, from the outside anyway. but my soul won't heal. and i can't forgive myself. and he never will. he never should.

559,I just need to rant real quick. Everything sucks. I’ve been stuck in dpdr for about 2 years now. It’s been bad but it’s gotten worse. My home life hasn’t been great for a while now. My parents have been fighting a lot and recently told me they were going to divorce soon. My sister constantly degrades everyone in the house and will sit around all day and refuse to go to school. My mom is having work trouble. And my dad has kinda been the punching bag of it all. Fighting and yelling has become a regular occurrence. I cant stand it. I’ve been trying to keep myself together and come off as calm so maybe some stress could be taken off of everyone but I’m actually falling apart inside. My theory is if they see that I’m calm they will have one less thing to worry about. I’m always anticipating the next fight between any of the three and it sucks. I actually feel a sense of relief at school because atleast I’m away from all this. But schools not any better. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t recognize myself in the mirror. I don’t see me I see a shell. I want to get out and run away from everything. Im only 15 so that’s not an option though. Nothing feels real and I just don’t want to be here anymore. I just feel stuck and I have no one to talk to. Every time I would try to talk to my mom about my dpdr she would say I’ve been looking at the internet too much. I don’t want to talk to her about it because im scared she’ll say that again or explode from all the stress. She also dumps all her work problems on me and that just adds to the stress.

I got used to just leaving the light on in the hallway if I got too scared, but today, I went to bed without the light, and looked out of my door (I'm used to sleeping with it open), and saw these stick figures and I'm telling you it scared the shit out of me, I literally felt my heart drop (thankfully, it stoped after a few seconds of terror, turning on my phones flashlight pretty much saved me).

She found a therapist and I started medication for ADD. It helped, and I continued taking it until I graduated in 2017. My freshman year, my friend had committed suicide. It never really hit me until his funeral. Where I promised to myself to never cause that much pain to the people that love me. I swore that day I would never commit suicide while I still have friends and family that love me. Just so I could never cause them that much pain.

I’ve only ever lived for the people I care about. Recently my 8 year long relationship came to an end. I tell myself it’s for the best. That I couldn’t treat her right anymore. That we grew apart. But she understood sadness and depression. She lived with it for all of her life. And I failed her by letting my resentment of our relationship get the better of me. I’m proud she was able to leave me. I couldn’t ever leave her, I wasn’t strong enough. So now I’m left with the realization. I have been living my life 3 months at a time. Never looking further because I feel that I will be dead by next year. Feeling like it doesn’t matter what I do. I’ve set myself goals and I’m getting therapy for the first time in over a decade. But I can’t shake the feeling of failure. The feeling that, no matter what I do, it won’t matter. Because I’ve masked this feeling since I was young. Because I believed the lie I was telling everyone. And now that lie is witness to the world. So my question is, Is anyone truly happy? Is anyone actually happy?

You try to have a real interest and love for things in this world, but it is not coming naturally. Due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about. Moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adult's body. Constantly thinking about self presentation and body language, always knowing that it is your outward presentation that largely impacts your opportunities in life.

And at the end of the work day you come home. You are exaughsted, but your job doesn't pay well. So you are supposed to use the time after work to study and work towards a better future. But you feel beaten down and tired when you get home. You can barely muster the energy to work out. If you do, it takes forever because you are tired and you can't focus. And if you are me, a day spent among the socially competent and likable is enough to send you into a negative thought spiral. Googling about how to improve social skills, feeling tired when you read about what you have to do. You are already tired. It is a compounding tiredness. You know it isn't your sleep or your diet. Both of those are in check. It's just life. A life that you are having trouble with feeling enthusiastic about in the first place.

Every day, the nagging thought that you will always be alone is ever present in the back of your mind. You can't stop thinking about those women who you did not have a choice but be attracted to romantically. Not in a very heavy way. They were just someone you actually wanted to shoot your shot with. And you know you failed with these women. And during the time you knew them, you sat and watched as the aforementioned likable, charismatic men of the world easily swooned them, entertained them, freely loved them, and their love was accepted. And you look at that and see that you are not like them. You will never be like those men. You can try every day to painstakingly get there.

You can try as hard as you can to relax and be a fun person to be around, but you never quite reach that state of being. You often wonder if you are not mentally/cognitively capable of being like those men. And you realize that all of this is making you tired still. In addition to feeling essentially doomed to be alone in this world, you are confronted with it's relentless challenges, and you wonder, what is the point of it all? Is this life worth living? Is there a reason to smile when you are the kind of person that you are in this world, and you can't seem to really change despite your absolute best effort, which you painstakingly put in every day, only to return to the same sad, tired state at the end of the day? It's difficult to get excited for life, when you feel socially incapable and generally unlovable. When you feel unable to bring value to other people as a friend, as a companion.

Another day wasted. A day of work is to be followed by a day of work towards a better life, for which there doesn't seem to be any energy. My mind is tortured with the thought that I am not fundamentally a good enough person to be with. This thought never goes away. I will always be alone.",Life makes me feel so tired,1
579,"I was talking to an acquaintance about my new job. I talked about how I enjoyed it and I seemed to be good at it. I started to feel self-conscious because I thought I was bragging, but at the end she told me not to be so hard on myself, and that I should have more confidence.

580,"I feel as if I am nothing more than a general nuisance to people. I say this because I had a falling out with someone that I once considered to be my best friend while we were both away at college last fall. I've known this young lady since high school, and I had a lot of trouble trying to make connections and new friends, and thus she was the only person I really had up there because I was so lonely. She felt that I wasn't giving her any space and that I was too intrusive, and as a result it feels like she wants nothing to do with me anymore. Sometimes, I question if she really wanted me around. I remember during her birthday last year, she had a bit of a celebration and I only found out because her then boyfriend posted it on Instagram. I felt left out. She said that she didn't want a large group and thus only invited people her parents didn't know, and planned on celebrating separately with people they already knew. When we did just that, she texted me two minutes before I was supposed to have her up that she was at a pizza party and would be running late. She did not show for another two hours. This past month, I've tried to reach out to her in an attempt to make amends, she barely responds to me. I asked if we could be able to talk in person, over face time or over the phone but I get no response. Because she seldom responds, I feel I have to start the conversation all over again. It's stressful, and it hurts my feelings.

Meanwhile, before I went up to college, I worked as a lunch monitor at one of my local elementary schools. This was immediately after I finished high school. While I loved working with the children, I had some problems there. Some of the kids were defiant, and very stubborn in their defiance. In the months before I went off to college, I tried to start a bowling club, but most of the kids would not even listen me and would just rough house and fool around. But the worst part was the treatment I was received from two separate staff members. During the 2020-21 school year, when I started working at the school, lunch was held in the classrooms and not the cafeteria. In the Kindergarten classroom I worked in, there was a young boy who had trouble remaining seated, and the teacher got angry with me. For two whole months, she would scream at me, calling me ""irresponsible"", complaining about ""how I can't be trusted"" and how I must be ""firm"". When I decided to be firm, which was what she wanted, she had another adult in the room at times while I was there. If she felt I was doing something wrong, why can't she treat me like a normal human being? Apparently, she would go around and tell other people that she has to yell at me. I filed a complaint against her to human resources, and apparently they felt she did nothing wrong.",I feel like a nuisance,1
581,"Hello everyone, I'm slowly losing touch with reality. I don't know if it's important, but I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since 2018, when I was hospitalized for six months due to burnout. Since then, I don't know if I'm truly happy or just pretending unconsciously. I started dating my boyfriend in 2019, but we broke up in late 2021 when he cheated on me with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. It was the first time I lost control over my actions and thoughts. I was sometimes treated as the perpetrator, even though I was just existing. In that state, I stopped eating and felt no energy to nourish my body, and even when I tried, I couldn't. I was on the brink of doing something stupid, fully aware of how foolish it was. Thankfully, I ended the relationship. I distracted myself with friends, some of whom were also going through breakups. I learned that alcohol could help me cope with my social anxiety, at least for a few hours, where I could enjoy the happy feelings without overthinking. I did this for about 10 months almost every weekend with friends, and it helped me try new things and gain new experiences. However, I always had a nagging feeling that grew into a thought. As I try to be the motivator in the group and the ""funny person,"" I feel like my problems are underestimated externally, and I'm becoming lonelier each week. I realize that I couldn't confide in anyone with all my thoughts. I always talked about my problems objectively but never let myself break down because I felt it would be too exaggerated and too intense. Now that I miss those weekends, I feel more isolated every week. I also have other things that bother me at home, making it hard to feel comfortable. My parents also only understand depression as a common cold that should be cured after hospitalization. I don't know what to do anymore; I feel like a stone.",Never talked to somebody,1
582,"I've been seeing this person for about 5 months and until recently everything seemed to be going really well between us. We texted most days and hung out around 2 times a week on average which felt like a lot considering their time off and energy levels. About a month and a half ago they told me they were having a depressive episode. I've never had a partner with chronic depression and was pretty ignorant to what it can do so I was taken by surprise when they started ghosting me about a week ago. It was very abrupt and everything seemed to be going really well until then. Since then I've tried my best to learn up and it and it seems like this kind of thing is pretty common among people with chronic depression, especially those who've had a long history of partners who do not react well to their depression.  


Normally, I would not tolerate someone ghosting me, but reflecting back on everything they've told me about their depression and how they're dealing with it made me realize how much effort they put into trying to address their depression and maintain a relationship in spite of it. They've confided in me a lot of trauma they've had to deal with in their life and the type of thoughts they struggle with. Last time we hung out in person I could tell they'd been really struggling with some of those traumatic events recently. Even during this episode they had some pretty traumatic events happen back to back but still made an effort to hangout and talk to me with everything extra they were now having to deal with.  


I would like to make an effort to keep contact with them for a reasonable amount of time and hopefully get back to how we were before the depression got this bad. The ghosting still hurts, and it's totally possible that they are just being a bad person and not telling me they don't want to see me anymore, but after researching it and talking about it in therapy and with some of my friends who deal with depression I think it's more likely they're pulling away due to the depression.   


Over the past week I sent two messages trying to be supportive and let them know that I respect their space and want to interact with them in any small way they want. However, I've learned that these longer texts (more than a couple sentences) can be harder for a person going through a depressive episode to respond to and might make them feel worse for not responding. Definitely don't thing the messages were bad or anything and the people I shared them with agreed, but it looks like going forward I should keep messages shorter and easier to respond to with an emoji or maybe even a small response.  


Given all this, I'd just like some advice from those also struggling with chronic depression about how you'd like a partner who you've been seeing for as long as I've been seeing mine to communicate with you during situations like this. My current plan is to keep going with my life, but text them again a week from now and maybe continue doing that for 2-3 months or until they tell me to stop. I don't want them to feel overloaded with my messages and push them away but I do want to keep the idea in their head that I'm still here and want to be with them. Thank you all in advance!","Partner with chronic depression started ghosting me, seeking advice",1

I haven’t handled becoming a full time caregiver to my very sick wife well. I haven’t grieved having to walk away from the work I love to do so. I haven’t managed to find any peace with the idea that I might never know physical or sexual intimacy ever again. 

My depression, anxiety, agoraphobia all pre-date these turns of events, but the way they’ve been amplified and my inability to effectively cope has caused me a shit ton of distress. I find that I tend to isolate even more than usual because I genuinely can’t imagine anyone wants to spend time or energy on someone with such a low self esteem. I have tried to take steps towards combatting the loneliness, but every time I get close to breaking the cycle I’ve created for myself, I run away and hide. I do wonder if this is because I know I can’t handle another heartbreak or rejection and so I’ve subconsciously determined the risks are too high, that connection with anyone else could push me over what it already a precarious cliff.

I just want safe connection. Someone who knows what and who I am going in and accepts the subsequent ups and downs while remaining as committed to my well being as I would be to theirs.

Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

612,I feel like I don’t matter. There’s a lot of sadness here and there too. idk.. I don’t see myself hanging in there for any longer. I guess I’m just tired of people hurting me mentally and projecting their ageism onto me because I’m a 27F. I don’t even think that’s old?

613,"I’m going to keep this short because I’m having a mental breakdown right now so it takes tons of energy to type.

I’m going to have to move to East Timor or something (country with the shortest people) when all my life, I’ve wanted to move to Italy. I just don’t know what to do. I would give anything to be even 5’3. That’s why it pisses me off so much when I see guys who are 5’8, complaining about how they’re not 6’0 or taller.

614,"So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as I continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled.  Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose.  I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc..  however, I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever.  It just felt awkward and silly.  I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all I write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.  So my first entries were very crude.  I'm looking at one now and it basically says : 

THC NJ is COOL
APPLY TO JOBS
START NEW RPG
GONNA COOK STEAK
START READING DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (finished it that week)
THIS IS MY 1ST TIME JOURNALING
MAY ADD MORE LATER, lol
TALKED TO LILY BILLY, need to more often

Then l stated a short gratitude for the day.  This first journal entry I was grateful for reddit, cause I believe I made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal.  I posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so.  My first entry was on 2-12-23. So I've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks I'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but I don't like doing that cause now I notice a sort of disconnect from myself when I don't journal habitually.  It's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress.  Thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it.  

I skip a week or so into my journaling and now I'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes.  Like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it.  I thought I would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what I use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits.   I just moderate it by USUALLY including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. But not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself.  You don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude.  If you don't feel it don't write it.  So yeah fast forward in my journal and I'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that  some goals and gratitudes.  Short term goals.  I begin to write about accomplishments I've made and things I see different in myself.  I talk about some of my inner growth but I'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half I've been fucked up like 20 of those days.  Or how I feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause I can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times.  Dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated.  I'll write how I finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment.  A big accomplishment I had to write down was hygiene.  When I was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression I'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering.  So I wrote down that accomplishment.  It effects self esteem, ego and confidence.  When you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better.  You have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, I can't believe I actually accomplished that, or shit I can't believe I even WANTED. To accomplish that.  Being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling.   Theres no real WAY to journal and I'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day (good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak) sometimes it's topics I wanna go down rabbit holes on YouTube and I'll mention it in the journal so that if I forget I'll  come back to that page on my own at some point and remember.  I could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now.  Must be pretty fucking cool.  Get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started.  Reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of GOOD information and I took what I thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as I wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but I've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as I continue doing it.  All in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself.  I know my explanation wasn't the best, so I recommend also searching reddit or Google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs. 

The end.","For anyone on the fence about journaling, this is my experience so far...",1
615,"i dropped out of high school, let me explain. 

when i was a freshman covid happened and i did online school up until i was a sophomore. Then schools switched back in person but i’ve always struggled with it, i’d get bullied, my friends would ignore me, and i’d just be alone all the time, the teachers hardly helped me, they always favor the popular kids. It’s not their fault. 

i tried a program for my junior year, they said they’d help me get the credits i needed. It was all online, at first it was okay, but after a month they dropped the bomb. I got a bunch of homework that was due within a week, then they wanted to do a test that was a huge factor in my grade and they wanted me to turn on my camera and answer every and any questions they had, and based on that they would give me my grade. It gave me bad anxiety, i wasn’t learning anything, the whole thing was just “do this do that” so i gave up. 

since then i’ve been thinking of getting my GED, my oldest sister got her GED, my friends brother got his GED, so maybe i can get mine? But i’m scared to go back into any sort of school setting, my anxiety was so bad in high school i couldn’t walk alone in the hallways, i felt like everyone was judging me or laughing at me. I could never make it to class even if i did i’d end up leaving. 

There’s a online option for getting my GED but i’m scared it’ll just be like that program i did and i won’t get any help, that i’ll just leave it again and never finish my school. But if i do in person i might have a breakdown, or disappoint my parents again, i hate that look in their eyes when they found out i had given up on school, like i’m a disappointment. 

what do i do, i feel hopeless. i wish covid hadn’t had happened, maybe i would’ve pushed myself to stay at that school

if you’ve gotten your GED or have info on it or advice please please please tell me",going back to school,1
616,"Title explains most of it. I wake up in the morning and think “fuck, I’m still here”, “fuck, another day in my life”. I never thought I would be this depressed in my life.  I’ve had bad anxiety and joked about toaster bath before, but now it seems like I genuinely just don’t give af. I never thought this would be me, and that just adds to the sadness. I just don’t even want to build the strength to keep moving forward… the one thing that brought me happiness in my life is gone, everything I based my life around. I don’t care about money, or a job, or anything like that. Now it feels like I’m just forcing myself to do things I don’t want to do because it’s expected of me..",I wake up every morning and say “fuck”,1
617,"These last 5 years have taken such a toll on me, that I just don't have the will to go on. My father was never in my life much, and my mother was more interested in alcohol and weed than myself and brothers wellbeing. The only paternal support we've really had is from our grandma. She has always done what she thought was best for my brother and me,, though she wasn't always able to give us the emotional support we needed. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager, and never had any sense of self worth or respect. The friends I had were their for convenience,  we shared some similar hobbies, and I was willing to do whatever they needed if that meant we could hang out. When I was 22, I started hanging out with a kind of bad crowd. We mainly got high and went to festivals and got drunk downtown. There were fun moments, but eventually an incident happened at a festival and I stopped hanging out with them. I did coke for the first time at this festival, and they all left me alone for the day. Afterwards, I stopped hanging out with them, more so out of getting my head straight, but none of then reached out to ke. Even to this day. I still see them from time to time around town, and they've all moved on to become better updmstanding people. Still hanging out together. Without me. After that happened I focused on work, did a bit of job hopping, started being healthier, lost a ton of weight (I was obese from middle school up to 23), and eventually my brother and i moved out into another apartment together with our grandma. He soon met a woman and got married, and they moved into their own place, so it was just me and my grandma. I did eventually meet a girl, and after a year I also moved into a place with her when I was 26. It was good for awhile, but her mom hated me. I wasn't extremely religious. I'm not against it in any way, but I don't need a book to tell me how to be a good person. She judged me from our first meeting, especially since I didn't come from a good stable background. I'm glossing over a lot but it had a significant impact on our relationship. We live there together for 1 year. I don't know when it started, but we would get into these intense arguments. She had a lot going on with her family and job,  and along with covid and isolation, the stress was too much for us to work through. After 7 months of living together we broke up. I left the apartment and went back to my grandmas place. We tried to stay friends, but I've realized that the changes in her personality have become too toxic for me. She knows my struggles with my insecurities, my depression, my anxiety, and even my family issues. Up until yesterday, she used that to manipulate me into being there for her emotionally. I kept struggling to break away, but she would bring up my past mistakes in our relationship and guilt me to continue being there for her. Anyways I went back to one of my old jobs, and was there until this past January. I left because I felt like I reached my peak. The customers were getting worse, we got a new manager who complete changed everything to their liking. I was overworked and felt undervalued. I didn't have a game plan, I just knew that for my mental health I needed to leave. Since then i havent found any kind of job. Since i left school, i dont hsve any qualifications except for retail, fast food, and other menial jobs. In the past year I gained back all the weight I lost. My body has been going through certain issues that I truly can't even afford to go to the doctor for. My grandma, bless her heart, hasn't  been too pushy about me finding a job. But I can see her irritation in her eyes. I know she's concerned about me isolating myself in my room. I don't even play games much anymore. I just waste my days browsing online, looking for jobs, and then just laying in bed thinking of my life. I have no one close around me. I have no friends, no SO, and I can't even talk to my brother about my depression. I know he's going through his own stuff, and he's tried to get me to play games with him but I feel like he should just focus on himself. The last two days I've been contemplating my life, my place in the world. I've come to the conclusion that I am just someone who doesn't belong. I'm not destined for a good life, not even an ok life. When I felt it was good it was ripped away from me, despite all my efforts to fix everything. I'm starting over from the bottom. Living with my grandma again. Overweight, jobless, and no real worth. I always felt so shityy for it, but I finally made my peace. I've struggled with suicide though a lot lately, I was afraid of actually going through with it because of my grandma and brother. Even my mommombit. I know they will be heartbroken, i know it will take some time for them to recover, but they will eventually. My grandma is so emotion strong, and my brother, while he will be more hurt from it, is also stronger than me emotionally. He also has his wife there to support him. We used to talk about suicide when things were bad, and he always said no matter what happened to us he would never be Ble to go through with that. I used to think I couldn't either....I guess I truly am a weakling. I know it'll be hard for them, but I feel that their lives will be so much easier once they don't have to worry about me anymore. I've made peace with it. They were the last things holding me back, but I don't feel worried anymore. They'll be able to live their lives when I'm gone, and I won't be a burden for them and for myself anymore. I'm exhausted. Every day is such a struggle to get up and try. Lately I've been having nightmares. They've gotten worse, and I feel this is the only way to stop. I'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of trying. I've accepted that I'm not meant for anything, and I've accepted I don't deserve happiness. I'm ready now. For the first time in 5 years I've bought some wine. I hate wine with a passion, but it aas on clearance and I just needed to get my head to stop thinking. Once she leaves for work tomorrowi think ill just drink myself stulud. I dont know whatll happen, maybe i wont go through wjth it, but this is the first time ive felt good about ending it. All i can think of is how itll be overoveri wont have to suffer anymore, i wont be a burden anymore. I wont be worthless anymore. Ill be forgotten, which i am ok with. If you took the time to read this I thank you wholeheartedly.  I know it's a bunch of ramblings, but it feels good to get it off my chest. I feel like with this I can take that step, and I will finally achieve peace. I hope if you read this, don't be like me. I am a weakling, but I hope you can use this to push on. Do what I couldn't do. I wish you the best of luck",I feel like I'm finally ready to end it all.,1
618,"Any advice or suggestions on what I should do? He's 19, dropped out of college because he have no passion in anything. He hates learning and have no friends. He's always in his room and refuse to leave. He would lock his door and turn off the lights. When my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them. Sometimes when we come back home and I check up on him, he told me he regretted it and said he's a horrible person.

I suggested him to get professional help. I'm also seeing a therapist to try to better myself. But my brother told me it's a waste of time and he doesn't want to talk about his feelings. All he does is play pc games from morning to night. Even till 3 am. My mom comes home from her night shift and when she saw that he's still awake they started a screaming match.

Now I just check up on him and try to have a decent conversation with him. I would talk about video games with him or other things he's interested. But most of the time he yells at me to leave his room.

I think he has a lot of pressure from my mom. She wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field. It might be partially my fault too.

TW: SUICIDE; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY.  


I want to start this off by saying I'm F15.

  
Ever since I was young, I dreamt about having an exceptionally great life. I dreamt of finding the love of my life, being rich, etc.  


Lately, I've seen my brothers getting that kind of life, and also lately, I was met with anxiety.  


I barely can't sleep at night, I'm extremely depressed, because I just have no hope in the future.  


Like, I feel like I'll never live the life I want, or find the love of my life, because I feel unloved. I feel, I don't want this to sound stupid, but I feel way too smart for some people, yet too dumb for others.  


I'm extremely depressed. Like, I hate how everyone is living their best lives, and I'm stuck in my home with my mentally ill  jobless 

  


  


  
mother, depressing, unloved, without anyone, cause I practically have no friends.  


And my brothers just have their own life.  


So I'm truly alone.

627,"Let me start that I used to feel shame and embarrassment about my depression. I used to hate myself and feel like a freak, and that nobody else ever went through the feelings I did. I was terrified of people finding out I suffered from depression, like it would make them think less of me and that I should be avoided and pitied. 

At some point, I had a certain epiphany, if you will. I concluded that depression is a normal thing that affects everyone. I have a feeling anyone who says they never get depressed isn’t being honest, or just afraid of judgement. Everyone gets depressed, and it shouldn’t be anything to be ashamed about.

I’m aware that, although everyone experiences depression, it doesn’t affect everyone the same. Some people, such as myself, have closed themselves off to people and made themselves a victim of this idea that they should feel ashamed of their depression and hide it from everyone, lest they be judged and ridiculed for it. 

But not me, not anymore at least. I think depression should be normalized, or at the very least accepted. People shouldn’t be made to believe they’re broken and need to be fixed. Depression isn’t something that needs to be “fixed”, it’s something that needs to be understood. The truth is, my depression isn’t going to just go away. It’s a natural, human emotion. It’s a part of the human condition, and only someone completely devoid of emotion would never go through it. 

I get it, it sucks to go through it. I know all to well, and can’t tell you how many times I just wanted to die. But i don’t regret my depression, because I believe it gives my more humility. I believe that by being more open and accepting of my depression, I can open up to others going through those painful, difficult times. I can show them that even though depression may never go away for good, there are ways to manage it healthily and effectively. I think it just starts by learning to understand and accept depression as a normal, human emotion that everyone goes through.

My bipolar was manageable without much medication prior to surgical menopause now im bat shit crazy depressed.  I don’t see my self aging well. I’m 46 now.  How has the older community managed their symptoms? Thanks in advance,Adding vvraylar to my Effexor regime. I’m nervous,1
636,"As the title states, I hate my fucking life. There is nothing redeemable or meaningful about my existence. I clean toilets for just above minimum wage to get by. Everyday is a sisyphean nightmare, I scrub the literal shit just for there to be more shit. Endless shit, such is life. It’s funny because everyone tells me I can do so much more, but is that truly so? I hate everything about everything yet have no real motivation to change. I’m just so tired all the time. 

Little background to paint the pathetic picture, I’m in my late twenties and live with my parents. I’ve had no remaining friends for several years now (for the better), have had a suspended license for 4 years, and my only sibling hasn’t talked to me in years. My parents and girlfriend are the last remaining positive things in my life, yet personal guilt blocks my appreciation of them. I honestly don’t deserve them. 

Why they haven’t discarded me like everyone else is beyond me. I’m a pathetic, self-absorbed, alcoholic blister. The only time I don’t experience crippling anxiety and the hollowness of my self- inflicted sadness is when skirting the line of a blackout. I have embarrassed my girlfriend and parents countless times. Despite my best efforts, I’m not a likeable person, even when sober. I hate that I have to not drink two days a week, otherwise the familiar beast of physical dependence comes knocking on my decrepit door. 

I’m not sure why I’m even bothering to write all this. It’s not like I’m capable or even worthy of change. I got cleaned up and worked a 12 step program rigorously for over a year in the past. Tried to convince myself that I could even make healthy friends and live a normal life. I also went on Prozac, which made only a negligible difference except for the broken dick. That facade quickly crumbled once I realized that people like me are simply not meant to be happy. I lived in nothing more than a hopeful fantasy all that time. 

In the end there isn’t much else to say. Life just isn’t fair, and I haven’t the energy to even complain anymore. The 18 yearold who locked 13 yearold me in his garage and shot me with a BB gun is a rich corporate lawyer. The highschool team-mate who regularly beat my ass is an investment manager for Merryl Lynch. If there weren’t losers like me, then there wouldn’t be winners like them.",I hate my life.,1

I thought it would be easy, since I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now, but I just can’t find the words to give any helpful advice. I’m really worried about them, and they’re addicted to a few things (though they don’t think that they have a problem), so I’m scared that whatever I say or do is going to make it worse, especially since they often talk about wanting to commit suicide. 

All I want is to help them, but they often stop talking about it once I start to sound worried.

What can I say? I'm depressed, very hard to find motivation to move on, to complete tasks. I'm in college now, and studying became so hard I can't describe. In school I was one of the best students and a couple years later remembering and learning even a tiny pieces of new information is extremely hard. Even if it's something relatively easy. Back in the daysI could read for hours, not only fiction literature, but books about history, science and everything. Now I'm barely completing the minimum to stay in college.

I'm trying to be more socially active, go outside, go to gym, try to learn something new every day but everything stays the same. Well, not exactly the same, because it just keeps getting harder.

I don't believe I'll be able to finish college, find love(I'm really bad at social interactions and meeting new people), find a job, and become happy. Every day it is only harder and harder to move on and deal with problems.
I've also fallen in love with a girl that don't find me interesting.
I hate being in love, because it never plays well, and in the end, all relationships I had, ended badly. My last gf dumped my on my birthday more than a year ago and I spent next half year to recover from that. Than I have fallen in love with this girl, we had some nice conversation and I did fall in love, but she didn't. Of course I'm not blaming her for that but damn, I haven't fallen in love like this since the second grade, my feelings for her are so strong. I usually lose the ability to speak adequately and formulate thoughts when I am around her.
On the bright side, two weeks ago I bought myself an acoustic guitar, which was my little dream for a couple of years, and I'm making some progress in that direction. And this despite the fact that never in my life I've done anything even relatively connected to music. But I like it.

But then, as I wrote my thoughts and feelings onto the page, I felt the presence of someone reading these words. It was as if there was someone out there who was willing to listen to me, to understand the things that I had been carrying around for so long.

As you continue to read these words, unfiltered and unvarnished, I feel a sense of hope. Hope that someone out there is willing to spend time getting to know me, to understand the thoughts and feelings that I keep hidden from the world.

It's a strange feeling, to know that someone is reading the things that go through my mind. But it's also incredibly comforting, to know that I'm not alone anymore, that someone out there cares enough to read what I have to say.

I don't feel lonely anymore, because I know that you're out there, reading these words. It's like we're connected in a way that's hard to explain, like we're sharing something special.

And so, as you continue to read, I want you to know that I appreciate you. I appreciate the time you're taking to understand me, to think about the things that I'm saying.

a boy in my class also told me that when i die, he will throw a huge party and invite the entire year group. this made me more excited to end it, gave me that motivation knowing that no one would care and instead see it as such an amazing thing that i’m not here. for once in my life i’m doing the right thing. i wanted to know more about it and would always bring it up to him in the class, asking who’s going to be invited, can anyone bring a plus 1 and where it would be. 

suddenly though life just happened, my mom was in an abusive relationship, she couldn’t take it anymore and so we had to move away to start a new life, new school, everything. i didn’t realise any of this was happening until we actually left. in that moment i just wanted to be there for my mom, she would be crying a lot and looked so drained. in a new environment having to start all over again, my original plan of ending it back home i just knew in my heart it wouldn’t work and my mom really needed me so i stayed alive

With this lack of guidance, I tried to go to supported internship places for a few years (I'm always told that because of my autism I need support). They got me some internships at various places (cafe, photography shop, printer's shop, charity shop), but I never felt useful. I always felt like I was too slow, and in the way of the actual useful people there that were just trying to do their job.

I lead with my ""job"" history like this, because it seems to be all society cares about. At every turn it seems like people are talking about their ""productivity"", and their life is based around that. Which makes me feel bad because I haven't been ""productive"" since I left college in 2016. I have no motivation to do anything. Most people work because they need money to live somewhere, eat and survive, but I'm a spoilt asshole who mooches off of their mother. We live on benefits, which easily pay the bills and allow us to live a very comfortable life, which I constantly feel bad about because most people my age I see struggling to even make ends meet, but this is how it is I guess. I'm sorry.

Sometimes things such as a new video game I'm looking forward to, or getting to hang out with a friend keeps me going and gives me at least enough motivation to not just lie in bed all day scrolling facebook or sleeping. But recently I haven't really had that. I play video games because it's something to do but I'm rarely excited about them these days. I very rarely (like a couple times a year if I'm lucky) do anything with a friend, because it seems like I'm always the one that has to ask to go out and do anything with them, but I don't want to bother them by asking that. It's lucky that I even have any friends. The rare friendships I have arise from me finding someone who has things in common with me (because if we don't have likes, dislikes, personality traits etc in common, I can't think of anything to talk to them about), and somehow finding the courage and drive to speak up to talk to them and try to befriend them. Which isn't easy because I'm too stupid to think of stuff to say a lot of the time, and my voice is really difficult for people to understand. But then because of a lack of me maintaining them, the friendships usually fall apart. People usually have much more interesting and less depressing friends than me that they'd rather spend time with I guess.

Maybe I should seek help. I have done in the past, I've had appointments with therapists. (I'm lucky enough to live in the UK with free healthcare. My deepest sympathies go to those who don't have this luxury and have to go into debt just to have someone to talk about their mental and emotional struggles) But because I'm so inarticulate and slow, and my thoughts are so scattered, it takes me a while to think of what to talk about, and the sessions only allow so much time. So usually not that much comes of it and I leave feeling unsatisfied, and what the therapist says to me usually don't really help, which is my fault because I'm fucking beyond help. I sometimes tell my best friend what's wrong, and she tries to help, but this is basically just me using her as a therapist, which is shitty of me, and she's too nice to tell me to shut up and stop being so depressing all the time. I feel like this is driving her away, which would be horrible, because it would be extremely difficult for me to find new meaningful friendships. I'm not sure where I'd go to make friends, and then there's the matter of me finding what to say, and my voice... but the point I'm getting towards, is, I'm not sure why people should care. I struggle with depression, but so do a lot of people. And those people probably actually have skills, and the potential to actually do something with their life. I feel like it's selfish for me to feel like I deserve help. When people suggest things to me that might help me to feel better, I never feel the motivation to actually do them. I'm stuck in my comfort zone I guess, of just lying in bed, occasionally playing video games when I can find the motivation to even do that, eating and sleeping.

First of all sorry for my bad English (Its not my own language) and second, this is a little peak trough my life and how I feel and what Im scared of.
Okay, Im 16 years old boy, who lives in a small town near big city, I dont have much friends but I do actually have a few (which I dont know if real or fake).
I have ADHD and Bipolar disorder but its not a big deal (I mean, its always fun with it). I am the class clown type of guy, I mean, I take everything as a joke even in the most serious moments. I feel like I am having the worst time of persons life. My head is a full mess and I often find myself comunicating with myself, which again is strange but I dont find it that bad. Whenever I go I get the same stare from people, Im always the goofy dumb friend that take everything as a joke and cant understand nothing, but I AM NOT. I want people to ztart respecting me, I have always been the good guy and I cant change that part of myself, no matter how hard I try (Sorry guys for changing the subject that quick, but as I said my head is a mess and I want to release everything that I have been holding back this long). For myself I can actually say that Im pretty smart but in the right moment (not in math class) but in situations that are on the cliff ( if you know what am sayin). I am not good at school but not bad either and I almost forgot to tell you, that I get the same piercing the soul look from my teacher as well. I dont know what to do? I am not good at anything, but decent at some things. I have tried many things such as sports, music, reading, video games. I just loose interest too quickly and everyone makes fun of me. I cant keep a normal conversation with a girl and I had only 1gf in my entire life (she left me for her ex). Im starting to get scared bc I dont know what to do after graduating high school (should I work, or study more, and If I do what?). My parents are really caring for me (have I mentioned that Im an only child and dont have brother or sister to rely on), but my mother is too imposing ( if thats the word). I know that they want the best for me and Im trying to be the best only son in the world, and it works but only for them. I am not the masculine big man, that girls want- I am just a small 13yrs looking boy who often people confuses as girl (and no, I AM NOT GAY OR SMTH). It just feels that Im noot good enough for anyone in this shitty world. I have a best friend who is an ""Alpha"" and cant understand my problem, because he have everything. I just want peace and love (is that so hard). I make myself goofy and clown to make people underastemate me, and I got to a pint where the things got out of control and became everyones toy.

I do everything else. I do all cleaning, shopping,  cooking, administrative,  and ect. I've had talks with him asking of him to do more and his defense is that he ""helps"" and it honestly pisses me off that he refuses to understand no matter how many ways I try to express to him I am struggling. He is a part of this household and I am not is caregiver.
Hes already not an affectionate kind of person. His version of cuddling is putting his arm on my lap for the maybe hour we spend together on the couch during dinner. And I except this about him. It just makes me feel even more removed from him when I'm struggling with my value.

708,"A couple weeks ago, I started a new job.

I'm a 30yo male web dev, with only just over a year of working experience.

My previous job was working for a guy building some side projects (mostly web3 based stuff), but we didn't run with any of them.

Well, a few weeks ago he told myself and the 1 other dev he hired that he needs to focus on his primary business, since that's keeping him too busy to really get stuck into anything with us.

It's understandable and he was even awesome enough to hook us both up with jobs at a another startup.

At first I was pretty excited, since this startup is also web3 based and most of my knowledge and skills involve blockchain tech.

Well, as it turns out they're primarily making use of the MEAN stack (more specifically Ionic) and up until a few weeks ago, I had 0 experience with that stack.

My experience is primarily writing smart contracts with Solidity and I would say I'm probably even above average, when it comes to it.

I also have a little experience when it comes to React/Next and Nest.js

Unfortunately for me, even though they're a web3 company, they don't need much in the way of smart contracts, and what they do need is a full stack MEAN dev...

I've felt like a fish out of water recently, but I've been trying my best.

For the past, nearly a month, I've been spending 70+ hours a week working and studying.

I'm pretty much either learning the tech, working, going to the gym here and there or sleeping.

I still feel like I haven't learned enough fast enough though and I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose this job...

If I do, I don't know what I'm going to do and that scares me and seriously gets me down.

I've seriously even thought about ending it all, if I lose this job.

Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest and if anyone has any advice or guidance, I'm open to anything.

Thanks.",My new job makes me want to be dead,1

Waking up every morning and getting things done are hard. If I didn’t have classes to go to, I would not move out of bed at all. Getting dressed and brushing my teeth are such a huge effort that it takes so long to get done. I feel neutral or sad almost all the time, like I forgot what feeling happiness is. Watching videos or listening to music would help sometimes, but I don’t find any fun in them anymore. I’ve mostly withdrawn from talking to my friends who don’t know but they don’t suspect anything yet.

I frequently wish I wasn’t alive by thoughts and urges but have not acted on it. Like not wanting to live but not wanting to die. I don’t know what I’m going through or if it’s all just a byproduct of stress and failure. Online tests and the DSM-5 all point to depression but my mind says I’m faking it.

I was reaching WAY above my station with her, so I always knew she would move on eventually, but it still broke my heart. I feel abandoned and alone…

This went on for multiple years and stopped at some point (as far as I know, Idk if I have just gitten blind to it) it was not too long after all of it that she started saying that she could not remember any of it, this has gotten to a point that I even started questioning my own memory of my childhood. I often find myself questioning if I remember something right just because of this and I can't really get myself to trust her 100% even getting scared of her sometimes that she might do something to me.

I also remember wanting to jump out the window at like age 10, the intend was there but I think it was also to see if my mother cared. I ended up not doing it because her reaction was just nothing, I didn't expect her to just not care at all.

I also had a lot of pressure due to my grades being very bad, I at one point got even worse grades due to me trying to escape into my fantasy, that did go on for about 2 years, therapy could have helped but no one thought of that.

like for example : they live in the street or whatever and they ask you what u would do if that was you and you’re so weak that you’re already laughing at how QUICKLY you would’ve kys in this situation ?? 😂 like you don’t even do it on purpose but u laugh because your life is objectively so much less tragic but you’re kinda like « bro I could nevaaaaah 😭💅 »…

bc i feel like this 100% of the time, i can’t do the easiest thing ? like just go out and study for more than 2 months without encountering situations that just proves me i don’t belong in this society/world ? 

i’m so so so tired but there’s a fucking thing that just tolds me i don’t deserve to die but i mean that’s a lie, everyone deserves it, especially me…

idk what to do to not suffer and not kms ? i don’t like anything anymore , i’ve been thinking the same thing since i’m 15, i don’t have a passion, don’t have a purpose, and i’m fucking angry with everyone…

i’m actually really jealous of people getting out of depression… because that’s what shows they’re normal ppl that are getting sad when something v sad happens to them.

it’s not my case, i don’t like this world and i don’t wanna live in it.

idk it makes me sick to see ppl wake up everyday to do things i will never ever want to do in my life.???

like wtf you obtain by watching sunsets and walking and just wake up everyday ? it’s boring…. there’s no purpose wtf i’m so pissed rn….

sometimes i even picture myself in if i would have lived the same way as my parents and I KNOW I WOULD KILL MYSELF INSTANTLY. 

i don’t picture myself to be happy, ever.

i even have a boyfriend for 3 years now and i’m even more sad. 

the only thing that makes my life a little better is drugs music porn alcohol and sex (and since i have a boyfriend sex is so boring and even now that we are in a open relationship i don’t even have the motivation to see people) 

i used to live for flirting with guys before, i really had nothing else that made me feel good…

now idk… i just feel like a depressive person going through a depression ?sometimes i can’t even get out of bed to roll a joint bc i have no strength…

i dropped out of school a lot and i have nothing to offer to this word (officially, bc unofficially i know i’m smart, i know how to help people, i could have made myself useful but 1) ppl don’t let me show them, bc i have no diplomas or anything to show them my worth 2) even tho ppl want me somewhere i end up burn out int and disappearing bc deep down i don’t wanna live this life. PERIOD)

also i have a very strong sense of value and i find so fucking pathetic the fact that anyone can just THINK they’re smart and could be useful while being actually just a loser all their life. 

as an example my boyfriend which is even dumber than me is always thinking he can be rich and can enter any school (thanks to me he knows he  set his expectations too high) but he believes he can get rich af without KNOWING A SINGLE NOTION IN FINANCE OR BUSINESS COURSES ??? (he doesn’t even have a GED equivalent at 22 and their friends and even parents says « thinking is not his specialty »)

like wtf that’s why i’m also so mad at him, bc he’s disposed to be a loser but unlike me he’s happy like a fucking moron ??? 

idk that’s just too much, now he wants to go live abroad. AND GUESS WHAT.
that stupid moron never ever thought about that in his entire life so he doesn’t know any other cultures or languages except our (french) and he still thinks he can get a job in a country like Singapore Canada Switzerland The US ?????!!!!

anyway he’s a pure reflection of how much my life is a disaster. 

mentally he is the opposite of what i’ve ever wanted and supported ? 

even politically he’s just following the trends, he believes what anybody says as long as it’s in a video….

anyway i wanna die but i don’t even hate him enough to do that to him.

715,"Just last year I was diagnosed with Chronic Depression, I was given antidepressants but I hated how I physically feel after taking it. 
It made me feel worse (dizziness and nausea are just a few). I was asked to go back see the doctor January 3 but I didn’t want to.

This time I promised myself 2023 will be better year as 2022 was a shitshow for me.

I wanted to get and feel better. I worked out a lot, did a lot of fun things, enjoyed old and new hobbies. But then at some point when all of the things I do are done I’m back at the pit of despair.

Sometimes I go out to new places and document everything, enjoyed a lot of alone times because yeah it was fun but most of it was the reason of “I don’t know until when my life will be”

I do feel shit, I have so much to be grateful for and I feel guilty to feel this way. But unfortunately I do.

I have to distract myself to avoid killing myself, how fun is that? Lol
I used to enjoy my alone and quiet time, now I still do but quiet?idk, sometimes I’m now I’m afraid of my own thoughts.

Tonight I laid down the floor, looked at the whole size mirror and stared at myself as if I was a dead person with open eyes. It felt so real, it feels like I am seeing the body in the mirror but I don’t actually see myself,  it feels like my soul left hahaha idk if it makes sense.

So many things to be grateful for but I just feel so empty, so tired I just wanna rest. It’s funny how I also start singing Sza’s song kill bill but I changed the lyrics to “ I just killed myself, not the best idea” 

I wish it was that easy to snap back be okay again, genuinely okay but nope, it doesn’t work that way tho. So yeah, I just wanna let it out here.

So what? I’m not one of them by any means. I’m not good at scientific research in my field, either. They say, some people naturally think like scientists. They ask the right questions, challenge ideas without taking them for granted etc. I’m not capable of that.

I’ve had an ED which allowed me to have an extremely low BMI so for some time I felt like I’m better than others at least at something. I was dumb enough to try recovery and now I’m technically not even underweight.

She completely moved on from me a few weeks ago, and she made it clear to me a few weeks ago that I was useful for a certain time in her life, but now I’m not useful to her anymore, so she’s moved on with new irl friends who she just recently met. 


After over a year of applying and interviewing, I got an office job in November of 2022. I was getting a lot of positive feedback, wasn’t screwing up any tasks, etc., but I was suddenly fired without a clear reason two weeks ago. I don’t have enough experience to reliably know if I’ll be able to get another job in the same field. 


I don’t have a job. I have literally no one to talk to, not even just an acquaintance or cousin. I don’t talk to anyone from any of the schools I went to, no one from any of the jobs I’ve had, and none of my extended family (family drama from a decade ago screwed everything up). My parents turned into raging alcoholics six years ago, so I mostly avoid them. I tried making friends at the most recent job I had, but I don’t think any of them really liked me, tbh. My family used to have family friends who would visit, and we would just do different things together in general, but we don’t do shit since they became raging alcoholics. 


Idek if it’s possible to recover from this level of isolation. There’s literally nothing in my life. I’ve went through almost 24 years of life, and I somehow don’t even have a single acquaintance to show for it, not a single person to talk to or who genuinely cares about me.",My life is just empty af,1

731,"Background - My brother is much younger to me and the youngest of four siblings. He has been dealing with depression and IBS since the age of 15. He is also suicidal when it gets worse. He is on psychiatric medications. We are a very dysfunctional family where my father turns everyone's life into hell to the extent possible. My mother has severe depression too. 

Current situation - So after two years of treatment my brother isn't getting any better. There are periods when he does fine but then relapses into depression. His IBS also gets worse and it bothers him a lot. He is in general very introverted and doesn't let anyone know what he is feeling except for occassional aggressive outburst where he is extremely angry and out of control for usual problems like his IBS.
My father is currently using financial abuse to torture my mother and brother who are financially dependent on him. But I am stepping up to help my brother financially and I tried counseling him and assuring him that I will take care of him no matter what. 
But his condition is not improving. He said he feels terrible that he is not able to be normal and do normal activities like going to college regularly or making friends etc. I told him that everyone's normal is different and he should work as per what feels good to him. That day he was fine for sometime but again withdrew to his room where he stays in complete darkness the entire time. It's been 5-6 days now. I have fixed a new psychiatrist's appointment for him and he agreed. But I want to know what else can I do in this situation. I want him to be fine and happy but nothing seems to work and he is 19 so we can't force him to do anything. Should I just let him take charge of his life and hope for him to get better? Or is there something more that I can do? No one else in our family is bothered or emotionally attached to him so it's just me. 
All advice would be helpful. Thanks!!",My 19 year old brother has depression.,1

I don’t feel like I can work anymore but I have to because I have to look after my fiancée who’s got BPD and bring in the money to afford food and rent. 

I don’t feel like I can look after myself. Insomnia has been a bitch for me for years, it’s only gotten worse in the last year. I like to maintain I’m doing well, but honestly I almost took some pills last night and locked myself in the bathroom. I don’t want to be here anymore. But I don’t feel like I can talk about it, because my partner always has something for their own on when I’m feeling low. 

I just bottle, I guess. I want to talk, I see a therapist, but, all the progress I make feels like it get reversed constantly. I haven’t felt this low in years and it’s hard to maintain a ‘it’ll get better’ outlook like this. When? When will this get better?

I’ve been bullied at work, punished for my disability at work, I’ve suffered through a narcissistic abusive mother and a father who just stood idly by. I’ve had an ex SA me and cheat on me. I’ve had friends lie and manipulate me, taking advantage of me. I don’t have a single family member I can trust anymore.

The only thing keeping me going is my dog, he’s only 11 months. I love him so much. I never want to lose him. 

The desire to leave and go to work and never come back is so strong. It’s so, so overpowering that I feel like shaking. I don’t want to feel like this.

750,"Just came here to write down my feelings. I have a fragile mental state, and am not good with sharing my feelings with my friends or family. I think people would generally describe me as someone with a sense of humour and as having good spirits. I am able to joke and laugh, tell people I am feeling great. But I have a dark side that nobody knows because I don't want to share, as I don't want to be a burden. Usually I am able to keep the feelings away, maintain the facade and stay strong and reasonably happy. But recently, things have not been going well for me, and I think what little resilience I had got washed away.

It is becoming hard for me to stay positive, because I feel so numb inside. I am becoming less motivated to do things that I enjoyed only a couple weeks ago. I don't want to socialise anymore. I have work piling up to the point that I am completely overwhelmed, but don't feel sharp enough or motivated enough to make a start to it.  I was drifting between two friend groups, and lost one of them because I decided to prioritise the other. I feel disconnected from my family and friends, mainly because they are currently so far away.

I hate the way I act, and am consumed by guilt and embarrassment when I think about my words or actions. A romantic situation I was involved with for only a month imploded, and I can't stop blaming myself, can't stop thinking about it or fully letting go. I have never handled rejection very well, and I have thought that maybe, the rejection that I received from her is the shock that caused me to crumble.

   * Im a people pleasere so I fuck my own schedule on a daily basis at work.
* Poor as fuck, all money went to court, batteling bill to bill now. (wife didnt have to pay since she is on welfare and then the ""tax-payers"" are paying for her court.

16.30-20.00 Time with son, food playing, goofing around etc. 

20.00-24.00 (8pm-12 pm) Work  


Those days where my son is not at my palce:   
I tend to get 1,5 hours traning in per day.   
Good foods and some rest in between aswell. 

But something like this, weekends looks the same

08.00 - 18.00 (8 am to 6 pm) work   
18-20 sparetime

763,"So I literally don't talk to anyone anymore. Super depressed, going about my days. I would be dead such a long time ago, if it wasn't for the weirdest most pathetic thing ever. The first person (and basically only time I've been truly in love) I doubt we'll ever hang out again, let alone end up together. But I love her so much still, so many years later, that even that .000002% chance of feeling us hold each other is just enough to get through another day. I'm 32 now. And it's been over ten years since I've had that feeling and experience. But out of all my ups and downs and insane experiences, traumatic shit, everything... She gives me the feeling I need to just get through things. Days. Sometimes down to the minutes and seconds. Her life is normal and fulfilling and pretty nice if you ask me, I doubt she thinks of me, and I'm not a strung out piece of shit like I was years back anymore, but no matter how normal my life looks now a days, it's so empty, and it's always felt empty without the feeling she gave me so long ago. I feel like such a pathetic loser for holding onto this love for so long, without reciprocation, without telling her, and with it having been the only reason I've ever got through how terrible I had my life in the past. I'll probably die with that secret someday too, but I just wanted to put it somewhere out into the universe. Even if it's just here on Reddit. That I've had this feeling I've held onto, that I've embedded into the fiber of my being, so that I take it everywhere I'll ever go, and it's the why to every breath I unconsciously take. I don't expect this to mean anything to any of you. But there's love in the world that no darkness can bring down, no drug could compare, no words can describe, and no time can erase, and I hope that you find it, and if you've had it and lost it as I have, may you live with that small hope you feel when you reminisce.",Sorry guys- I gotta take a thoughts n feelings dump right here 😬,1

for a better understanding, i harmed my body and soul so many times because of untreaded trauma ( i think), i drink booze on the weekends since my 18th birthday, and later some party drugs came in.

if i would have a glimpse of which pain i will live through back in the days i would have never touched any drug.

with the booze and the drugs came panic attacks and anxiety disorders.

I found this article today and I feel like it describes exactly what’s happening for me… but for me I’ve been experiencing anxiety and depression.

I’m 28 and have a long long history of mental health issues. Generally speaking they’ve improved over the past 4 years with lots of ups and downs.

Since December life has been highly stressful: Death in the family, health issues, housing issues, work, school, you name it. 

I had SO much adrenaline pumping through me for months.

The past 2 weeks everything has settled: I found stable housing, moved in with my partner and the relationship is great, school is done, my Dad is supporting me financially. Everything is suddenly great…

Except the past week my mood has dropped fast. Intense anxiety, crying at work… the worst part is, I’m supposed to be feeling happy? There’s nothing that can explain the feelings?

So this “let down effect” is my best guess. Anyone else experienced this? I’m praying time will start to relieve some of these horrible feelings…",Let Down Effect?,1

771,"I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time now, and eating disorders in the past that have not fully healed.

The trigger this time was that I saw a photo my broyfriend took of me and my legs appeared enormous to me. That single thought that arised from a photo that a loved one took on me, lead to not eating in three days, self-injuries and an endless loop of feeling like shit. I feel so narcissistic and chidlish, why would my looks be at all THIS important? Still now I cannot get over it. Just seeing my legs in a photo that was taken with love. My boyfriend almost threw me out of home cos I was behaving like a fucking idiotic child.

Yet it is so hard to get out of the loop, I literally have nothing that makes me feel happy and I consider myself to be under the normal for intelligence and I don't have any special skills so I don't see a point in feeling better with myself. I feel so miserable, so useless, I only bring dark stuff to my lovely boyfriend. It's like I know how to get out of the loop (my therapist gave me many tips) but still when I am in the middle I cannot get out, my mind is racing with destructive shit that I believe and I act according to all these thoughts.

The eating disorder has already been on for 13 years and I am already 30. I never imagined at this point of my life I would still be dealing my so many instrusive thoughts and still thinkking this is such a big of an issue. Its like really, who is going to notice I put on weight? and if they do, why would it be so importnat? there are far many things more importnat than looks, but I seem to not be able to get over it anyhow.

My meds arent working, group therapy has never helped, the hospital made me worse, my mom and stepdad lost my trust by screaming at me.

Fear and anxiety rule his every thought , loneliness and despair fill every breath in his lungs. 

Darkness reigns unchallenged, the light is all gone. Feelings of happiness extinguished and drowned, deluge of pain and suffering watered them down. 

Like an ancient warrior facing certain death, wounded , bruised and bleeding he marches on. 

Flashes of memories that are long gone, hints of an era that once had begun. With fire and passion his heart once fought. Stabbed and damaged it won’t pump blood , only anger rage flow thru the holes. 

For his Queen he swore once that death he would take. Just to protect her from the evils out there. But no one had warned him of the evil within. A festering wound that ends in gangrene . Rotting soul and heart but not too fast. Ensuring he suffers as much as he can.

The dream of a life was just a mirage . Leading the warrior into an inescapable trap. Battle after battle, war after war. Trenches of anguish is where he stands. 

What was the purpose the man thought to himself. Looking around for someone to help. No one in sight to hear his plight, only more darkness and none of the light. 

Hopeless and tired he kneels on his sword. With honor and valor he lets it all go. Plunging the steel makes the flesh cold. Followed by warmth of the pouring hot blood.  

Seconds feel like years as life flashes by. He enjoys every memory with his last ever smile. 

But out of the darkness someone reached out . Returning the light and the life that ran out. 

The warrior perplexed looked almost scared , for he had never encountered no one that cared. 

His story unfinished and with no clear path. But now he’s determined to let go of the past. 

Wounds that are healing wounds that will come. Master the pain that will never be gone.

798,"I've (25f) been going through the most stressful depressive episode i've ever been in and I can hardly get anything done. At best, I get maybe 1~2 hours of work done in the afternoon before I have an anxiety/stress/depression(???) attack and my body decides to just shut down. Literally, it's hard for me to move and i'd collapse if i try to stand, i can't keep my eyes open, and it wears me out to the point that afterwards I just lay there and try to do something low energy like reading until I get up to make sure I at least eat something and spend some time with my parents. I can usually spend a bit more time on work if I'm feeling particularly good or hobbies like music and art if I don't have another attack at night but I'm also only productive for maybe 1~2 hours before I switch to something low energy again . Really my low energy activity is mostly just reading fiction. Sometimes I'll try to play video games but that's rare nowadays. (My therapist knows all of this and we're working on it. Still gotta handle it in the meantime though). 

I'm not employed right now but I do remote volunteer work that takes probably 7~10 hours a week. I can get my work done but I feel like im seriously hanging by a thread. I'm also job searching but to be honest, I have no idea how I'll hold down a full time job. I'm not sure I can even really hold down a remote part time job truthfully. I've considered at least taking small freelance gigs but it's difficult to get going.

799,"I am 20 years old, and a university student in South Korea.

When I was in high school, I was betrayed by friends who I really trusted. I experienced that one of my closest friends got bullied and quit school. I was so afraid, and I tried to befriend students in other classrooms. Therefore, they were my best friends. 

During the field trip, they said that they disliked me and asked me to leave. I was so shocked. I tried to talk with the teacher, but it was meaningless. After that, I was alone, and I spent days in fear. A week later, I was diagnosed with severe depression. I really had tough times. As I tried to commit suicide, I was hospitalized for 2 months.

I believed that the only way to change this situation is going to university. I studied hard and others said my achievement is a miracle.  However, my time stopped in high school. My heart and the way how to treat others are the same as a high school student like the days, I spent the whole night crying. I am good at making good relationships with professors. I treat them politely and as people who I have to learn. Meanwhile, I am not good with friends, because I am so afraid and don't know how to make a good relationship. 

Have you seen 'The Glory'? They said victims were abandoned at times they suffered. I totally understand what they meant. 

Fortunately, my medication is almost over. The psychiatrist will not prescribe antidepressants soon. That's what I dreamed and wished for. However, I am so afraid, because “I am cured” doesn't mean “my past is recovered”.

He used to be in a gang in Vietnam but dropped all of that just to go to the US and start a family, he tells of how gangs of kids in their school would jump the fence and literally start fighting and shoot at each other with marbles using slingshots

He tells me stories of his childhood and how at one point at my age (18) he fought off 2 guys and defended his mom by throwing his bike at them

803," 

A guy in the tail end of high school liked a girl who was his classmate so much but did not ask her out because they were friends. Also, the guy had low self-esteem. After they were close and sometimes flirted but nothing serious, they continued to be friends through college even though she studied out of town. Every time she goes back home, they hang out.

During college, the guy majors in chemistry, and during the third year, he got depressed and caved into pressure and had a panic attack due to not catching up in school and the idea that he is a failure to his parents. That resulted in him not going to school anymore. He did this in secret throughout the semester, so when the next semester is up, his parents discovered that he stopped going to school and instead wandered around town and wasted time in LAN cafes. During this incident, he cut off all communication with his friends and acquaintances. He was lonely during this time. After his family discovered the incident, his family already saw him as a failure, and it was clear from their eyes and the way they treated him. This got him more depressed and ashamed.

At some point, he realized he had lost the motivation to do anything productive. He did not know when it started, so he pondered and remembered when he was last motivated and realized that it was only because of his friends back then. Then he thought back to his childhood and realized he would rather not try to do anything because if he made a mistake, he would be punished. And if he did good, then nothing. Maybe he was not motivated at all because he was raised in a negative punishment methodology of parenthood. He blamed his parents for the things that he was, but he also realized that his parents did everything to provide for his needs except for the needs of warmth and recognition. He was conflicted.

His parents asked him to go to school after the school year ended, and he accepted. As he was ashamed of what he did, he studied in another town. During his studies, he realized that he could not make any meaningful connection with anyone at all. He realized again he was lonely.

During this second chance of studying, he heard news about the girl he liked, and he felt things. When it was good news, he was happy. When it was bad news, he was concerned. One of the guy's high school friend's fathers died, and he saw her again. It was weird. He realized he loved her and he now only loves the idea of her, a type of obsession of pain, as every future that the guy saw was with her. But she is now in a happy relationship, and the guy she is in a relationship with is great, and the guy thinks that they would be married, and the guy also thinks it's good for them to be married.

 After graduation, the guy returned to his hometown but remained unemployed. He felt lost and uncertain of what to do next. He often thought of his past mistakes and regrets, including not pursuing the girl he had feelings for and not taking his studies seriously.

As time passed, he became more and more discouraged. He didn't have the motivation to pursue any opportunities that came his way, even those that could have helped him grow and develop his skills. He spent most of his days alone, feeling like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of hopelessness and despair.

Despite the encouragement of his friends and family, he continued to feel like a failure. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had let everyone down, including himself. He knew that he needed to make a change, but he didn't know where to start.

The future was uncertain, and he didn't know what would happen next. But he knew that he couldn't give up, even when things seemed impossible. He would continue to search for a way out of his current situation, hoping that one day he could find his way back to a brighter future.",an inchorent story made cogerent by gpt sothere mught be a little additional dramatic effect,1

I have deadlines and things to do and I really really want to get out of this vicious cycle and get better. But every now and then, I completely lose hope. I don’t really want to die, because despite everything I maintain my optimism that things can and will change. 
But in the meantime… how am I supposed to function to get there? Change only happens with actions. I don’t have the energy. I’ve lost all motivation. 

My main problem these days is: what’s the point? I see what’s going on in the world and everything is going to shit. People are fake as fuck. The only things that matter to society are extremely superficial. I don’t understand how people function in this society. 

It’s probably also helpful to mention that my home life is an epic disaster. I had to move in with my parents because I don’t work currently (thank you depression) and for the past year and a half, they have been in a pre-separation mode that they won’t conclude. I think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves. My mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life. My dad is a narcissistic liar who won’t deal with the truth. My siblings are pretty toxic and I am the one that they all depend on for emotional support. The thing, no one is really there for me. 

Anyway. This was a rant I needed to let out because I don’t really have anyone to vent to. I don’t want to burden my boyfriend with my depression, he doesn’t deal well with it.

I hate that I’m aware that I’m making a fool out of myself yet again, I still choose to believe. I can’t ever stop thinking about this. It is the only topic ever on my mind. I hate seeing happy couples, I hate seeing people happy in general. I hate seeing people have fun while I spiral down into my own mental ruin. Whenever I get a opportunity to talk about my problems I never do it. Matter of fact, I don’t take opportunities to anything. I have only a couple “real friends” besides the people who are just horrible to me. No matter what I do, I’ll always be judged. I’m tired of being treated like an outcast for no reason.

835,"Greetings, I am new to this sub and relatively new to Reddit. Let me give you some background on why I’m posting here. I ran across a post about a month ago from a young teenager about being depressed and all that (you know, the typical teenage woes). Out of kindness, I replied with some words of comfort, and after a while we started messaging and have kept in touch since. I am by no means an expert (outside of my personal experience dealing with depression and anxiety most of my adult life), but all signs point to him having some sort of mental health issues.

Like everyone, he has had good days and bad days, but lately things have taken a darker turn and I’m realizing I’m in over my head. For a while our conversations never involved suicide, and I know I’m not really equipped to help people struggling with those thoughts, but now it’s come up a few times and I’m starting to feel like I could be in danger of inadvertently saying the wrong thing or somehow making the situation worse. My first inclination was to steer him in the direction of talking to parents or another trusted adult, getting therapy, etc., but for several reasons that’s not an option right now.

At this point, I’m completely committed to helping this kid get the help he needs and I won’t abandon him just because this situation has become more complicated than I originally anticipated. I started myself down this road, and I won’t give up until I know he’s safe or at least in the right hands. I don’t want to get into any details in this post, but I could really use some advice from anyone who understands how to talk to a very depressed / suicidal kid who probably has mental health issues and is desperately searching for a reason to keep living.","Trying to help a friend, I’m in over my head.

839,"Did anyone else have very few hobbies or interests growing up? I'm 20m and for the past 4 years, I haven't gotten into any hobbies or interesting things. I have a hard time relating to people because I don't have anything to talk about. It feels like I don't have a personality. 

My whole life has been dedicated to pleasing others. Doing what I think they want me to do, saying what I think they want me to say.  I'm struggling with having interests because I honestly don't even know what I like. 

Because of this, I don't really have any long-term goals for my career, hobbies, personal growth, etc. I just want to be a normal, functioning member of society but I'm struggling to find an identity. I end up laying in bed all day, working towards nothing because I'm too scared to even try.

840,"Don’t really know how to explain this further. Throughout my life I’ve been tortured with medical issues and a dysfunctional family and so on and so fourth. This made me able to “resist” depression if that makes sense. I could, essentially, ignore it. I could force the happiness through and suppress anything else.

Little things have made me happier than normal over the last five months, including someone I thought was my friend, until it became obvious that likely isn’t the case. Before this I had entire, fantastical and delusional ideas about what the next few months could look like between us.

Things are getting worse between my family too, and now I’m dealing with a shitton more responsibilities that will likely be falling on me within a few months from now. That and this crumbling relationship (only friendship, and the farthest one has ever got for me) are starting to push me to the end of the line. I’m finding myself randomly breaking down more often and I feel like, unless something drastic happens, I’ll explode.

The best visual representation of this (it’s fairly stupid and niche, I know) is a scene in Umbrella Academy 3 (ep 7, trying not to spoil anything) where a big problem was averted, then this was celebrated, and then the crisis comes back with more ferocity than before in an extremely short amount of time.","Does anyone feel like they’re on the edge of a cliff of being content/happy, and one small thing could make you fall off?",1

I have tried countless times, and failed every single time. The more succesful attempts at recovering never lasted either, and it's always gotten as bad as things had been before.

I’m just looking for any ideas of how to help myself really. I realised a few weeks ago that I’m depressed.

845,"I am 27 (M). I am married and I have an amazing, loving and supportive wife. However, I am divorced. My ex-wife hurt me pretty bad, but not how most people would think. She had two sons and I happily raised them as my own (#1) and things were great. One day, she made the suggestion that I should get a vasectomy because neither of us wanted more children and we were both completely happy with our lives at that point. She didn't force me too, but I did it. I trusted my wife. I got the procedure (#2). Fast forward, one day, I find my wife in my bed with another man, such decency.

We divorce, I lose everything, as most men do. I lose my wife, I lose my children (that I raised from infancy, but aren't biologically mine, so I have absolutely no rights in the state I live in and I have never seen them since the day she left). 

I get married, I tell my now wife up-front about everything. She loves me anyway. I can't shake the feeling of what I have done to myself. To take it steps further, I work in child welfare. Everyday, I see people who have children and they piss it away. I would give anything for that opportunity. I paid thousands for a reversal and it wasn't successful. I've never been a suicidal man and I've never felt any panic type emotions until all of this hit me in the face.

Everything I have done to myself. I know life isn't over, but I now have to face the reality that I could quite literally die alone... And I am 27. I've tried medicine, I've tried exercise, I've tried counseling, for months. Nothing shakes this feeling of emptiness. I feel like I was set up and robbed, but what was taken was worth much more than money. I don't know who to call, I don't know where to turn.. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to be but.. I know my wife loves me. I just don't love myself anymore. I feel like the stupidest and most naive man to have ever lived. I trusted my wife. 

Most 27 year olds, you know, they do stupid things. I've thought about suicide but not because I don't want to be alive. My parents just think I was stupid for ever making that decision. All I can respond with is, ""Yeah, I was pretty stupid."" And that's it.

I lay in my bed every night with a beautiful woman and I cry myself to sleep because I robbed myself and I robbed her and I can't cope with it.

848,"For the past 4 years I've (18m) struggled with depression, I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents (a violent fuckfest) when I was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication (ritalin) by snorting it.
Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

I don’t think it’s possible to get completely rid of this feeling. Being utterly miserable, unlovable, a waste of space. It stays with you. Hearing a professional tell me I was mentally ill felt like a truck hauling a bus had ran me over, but that acknowledgment was merely confirmation that I wasn’t crazy. I’m not like the ordinary person who is able to smile without hiding their true self, the person who can be optimistic, the person who doesn’t think twice about hanging with friends and loved ones.

But it’s fine. If this is my slice of hell, fuck me someone else has it worse out there. At least I have a community (granted not everyone or anyone will read this but it’s importance is justified), I have a space I can just cry and rant about how much I fucking hate it all and they get it.

863,"Back when I was in high school I was struggling to make friends and didn't have the greatest of home lifes either (my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration I would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases, physical action would be taken as well). Back then I was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude I constantly found my self in. In order to try and combat it I did theater programs run through my school. The high school I was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department. Though run by about 3-4 teachers, the school was known for how much it did within the field. the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year, the music students took trips to music competitions, with everyother year taking them to a competition in NYC. I loved theatre, even did quite well in it up until I was about 21, but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it. It was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other. Casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was, I wanted something like that. So I joined the select choir, that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows (well, as subtle as people in that field could be). I did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year. now long story short I was never accepted fully into their family, it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups, but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible. So some days with rehearsals or performances I would be at the school starting at 7 am until 11 pm. So I dedicated myself to the shows, they were the one thing that really kept me going. Cut my senior year, I was known for being a bad student amongst my peers. I never did homework because I would be too depressed at home to do it, so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits. None of it worked though, mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a 90 percent on any test, it led me to focus on theatre instead. I loved it at this point, the fall semester I was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this. Not only that but my school vocal director, who doubled as the musical director, chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into. I mean I think the show spent around 200k, fabrics imported for India, a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound, costumes rented from the former professional touring production, it was a lot. I was excited for the year, my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once I had a piece of the future to look forward to, even if it was only 6 months worth of future. It didn't last long though. before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom, one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things. When pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show, if he didn't then she'd have to do her senior show without him. Another guy started to help her out of what I could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions. the guy realized that they shouldn't be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her. I wanted friends, so I did. I told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it, we talked about the call back list. The director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it, they all said I had done it in search of the call back list. None of them said that anything about the other two students, they didn't tell her how I just read out what they had found, they placed everything on me. I don't know why they all did this, I dont think I ever will, but it led to the director to looking to see if I had done anything else. Apparently at this point other students had claimed that I said that a girl wasn't in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears, first off that was wrong because I distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it. She was and still is extremely talented and I've never claimed anything else. Next these students said I read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it. Now with this, I did read this transcript, the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about 2-3 weeks and one day I picked up and read it, made a comment about to to other students in the room, and put it back on the table it was. Unknown to me at the time, that student had dropped out, hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long. I know the entirety of that situation because I had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out. He told me it was fine and didn't know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened. Unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out, and that I according to others had bullied him. She pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me, she told me how she knew everything I'd done and that there's no reason to attempt to lie about anything. She said I was the reason that kid dropped out and that I robbed her of the chance to save him, she said I violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information, and she said that she couldn't believe I would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasn't up for a role where she really was. I didn't know what to do, the director what certain in what she knew and I knew she wasn't changing her mind on any of it, so I just through tears said I was sorry, that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. The director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and I didn't know what to do. So as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl, I was to never be in her classroom without her being there, and that she couldn't in good faith help me with any college auditions. She finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didn't know if she could ever trust me again. It broke me, I isolated myself for the rest of the school year, she thankfully still let me be in the show that year, but I tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if I wasn't spoken to first. I applied for other degree fields at colleges. And outside of school I rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming. 
I didn't perform for over year after that, I couldn't get myself to be near a stage. I eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college I attended and got in. But after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing, and the anxiety that I would just be someone's scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me. I developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder, and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all, leading at points to trips to the ER for internal bleeding. I quit performing for good after that, I haven't been on a real stage since I was 19, and I haven't performed since I was 21. I'm 23 now and I don't know what to do, I had to drop out of college because of my mental health, my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea, threatened to divorce her and list me as the cause.im stuck in a deadend job working 60 hours a week and I've lost all will to do anything.

(m/22, if you care)


First things first, I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.
And sorry, if my english isn't good...

So, I've been battling depression for over a decade, I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

I've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind, even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.
I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

I just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something I still can't do. Love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.

Anyways, I hope I can force myself to focus on something else now that I've written this shit down. My mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.

You know, I try really fucking hard. I practice gratitude whenever I can. Everyday I wake up and I journal.

I’m the guy people can count on to help them out with anything they need. I love people and helping people. 

I was an idiot in my 20s chasing the one that got away in a toxic on again off again relationship and when I finally thought it was all going to work out I got cheated on by her with a guy twice our age. Years later she wrote me a letter apologizing for it all. I fell into depression and let myself go after this. I came out of it and managed to find purpose in my work and hobbies. I lost 100 lbs to get in shape. And… nothing. For whatever reason I can’t find love. I’ve literally traveled to every continent on Earth, made a lot of money, taken care of my physical appearance and for whatever reason I still can’t find anyone who loves me which makes it all feel so hollow. I don’t feel like anyone owes me love, I’m just sad and depressed that halfway through my life I can’t say that I’ve ever truly received it despite trying pretty hard to find it for a long time.

Recently I started seeing a girl who I thought had the potential to be the one for months and now she has had some freak personal trauma unrelated to me but that is causing her to push me away and now I’m just sitting here in my empty house again. I wanted to have a family and every day it feels like it’s more likely it will never happen. I am not suicidal in any way but it definitely feels like dying on the vine inside each day that passes.",Lucky in everything but love. Makes it all feel so hollow.,1
901,God I feel so helpless and defeated. I don’t feel like living this week. Birthday was spent alone and awful. Friends ghosted me for no reason.

Nobody cares about me.,It’s been such a bad week I just wanna cry,1
902,"im currently in therapy and we’re talking about being more social with friends as well as setting boundaries. my therapist is aware of a friend group i have, about my only close friend group, of 3 guys (im a girl). boys like to roast and they like to be really, really mean. i often question why i’m still friends with them at this point because i can’t talk to them about personal issues, we no longer all have the same interests, i have a career and they don’t so having money/not having money affects us actually doing things such as traveling (which i always want to do, but scared to do alone and they’re my only options)… but really when i think about it i just don’t enjoy their friendship. there’s one “friend” in particular who always brings up my ex even though i’ve asked numerous times to not update me on what he’s doing. i’m currently trying to recover from that emotionally &amp; mentally abusive, toxic relationship. matter of fact, he’s the reason why i spiraled a few weeks ago because he brought up something about without even warning me. 
circling back to the roasting, they will so easily bring up this trauma as a “roast” and something to laugh at, invalidate my mental illness, and make fun of me for attending therapy because i’m “wasting money for someone to tell me i’m normal”. i fucking hate that i can’t seem to let go of their friendship despite how awful i feel about all of them, but i feel like without them i don’t have anyone to do things with or talk to all the time. idk what to do. it’s either be alone and have them in case or just be alone period and obviously that will just continue this cycle of loneliness and dark depression. wtf do i do. ☹️",i’m so alone.,1

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core.

I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends.

My ex and I broke up almost 7 years ago. It was a horribly messy and terrible break up that caused me to be suicidal (we both made mistakes). There was never any closure and it always felt like it should have ended differently. It often felt like she felt the same as well...at least back then (think she might resent me now).

Been having some real down moments lately and I've been thinking about my ex a lot. I'm still attached to those days and emotionally often feel stuck there. There's still a giant piece of me that belongs to her.

I've been in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years but I have quite a few things I lied about in the early parts of our relationship. I feel like it's so unfair to her.

921,"I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression. Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers: profesionally, academically, relationship wise. I am 27 now and things haven't really improved.

Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone, namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just ""man up"" basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.

I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid, working a job I have grown out of for years.

Relationship wise, I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.

I do not feel like an independent person, up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.

I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle, I immediately resort to these two things.

Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. 

I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.

940,"Hello, 

I am male and twenty years old and actually I have a great life: I have great parents and a brother, I was successful in sports until my injury and I finished school very successfully a few years ago. In the meantime I have also almost finished the first part of my studies and I am successful there as well. In addition, I have a great - albeit small but fine - group of friends.

Somehow I have been feeling weak and tired for some time now and can't really motivate myself to do anything. I think a lot, especially about the past.

My school days were difficult at the beginning because I was bullied. I am almost highly gifted and always had difficulties to get into a really casual conversation with other people. Also, I had different interests than kids my age. After I changed schools, the situation was immediately better and I had made real friends for the first time and also developed self-worth. I just went through with school and left all the dating stuff alone, following the motto ""Will come around then, I have time"".

At the same time, it was always difficult in my family, too. My depressed and schizophrenic grandmother hates my parents, even though she lives next door to them. The whole thing goes so far that she says things like she would rather be dead than live next to people like my parents. 

Because I moved out to study, I was able to escape this somewhat, but it still depresses me because I am her only confidant.

Some time ago I tried dating and was only disappointed and hurt. I had not thought that rejection offends me so much. However, I have always been able to pick myself up again after recovery periods and continue. Then, about two and a half months ago, I met a girl - completely unexpectedly and unfortunately online - who completely enchanted me. And vice versa as well. She doesn't live quite nearby, but I have no problem with having to drive and it's not so far that we can't see each other every weekend. We then had together after a few meetings also our respective first kisses and now just look where the journey goes....

This feeling that I can actually be attractive and appealing is indescribable to me. And I have noticed how much I have always missed physical closeness the last few years, although I NEVER wanted to admit it and have always denied. 

The whole thing triggers a total existential crisis for me and throws me off track: Everything I have lived for the last few years now seems useless and disgusts me. I read my resume and am disgusted by the stringing together of courses, successes and professional experiences. I feel bad because for the last few years I've always laughed at couples for not getting the rest of their lives together. I feel bad because I've always tied my self-worth to achievement and now I see and feel that that's not actually what it's worth living for. But that it is love that one should live for.

Am I depressed and do I need professional help? My problem is that as a future civil servant I could then have problems with the medical officer and then no civil service relationship could come about. Do you have similar experiences or tips on how I should best deal with this?",Am I depressed and if yes why?,1

But now I’m sitting at work at 10pm getting ready for a 12 hour shift regretting how stupid I was as a kid for letting myself be pushed away from trying something new to fall into the 9-5 (or 11-11 in my case) rhythm that my family hated so much but pushed so hard for.

943,"I have no friends at this point due to either my own mistakes or just things not working out. I had a falling out with my family so I'm essentially NC with them, and on top of that I recently moved to an entirely new state. I had to sell a lot of my belongings that helped me cope with my depression, such as my laptop and PS5. 

My partner is a fantastic person and the moments I get to spend with him everyday are a blessing. He has similar issues,  but I insisted he kept his computer since that's his lifeline. On top of that, he has numerous social circles who adore him.

I've been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing, and it stings when I'm awake at night sad and alone,  and I hear him talking to one of his many friend groups. They play games, have fun, just hang out. He'll do this all night, and I have to sleep and wake up to him having fun.

I asked him to keep his belongings and I love that he has friends, but I just get so upset that he has things that I just cannot have - a loving family, friends who would never replace him, games he can play - it makes me so irrevocably depressed that I just can't have those things for some reason. I have autism, ADHD and social anxiety and I try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day, it isn't his problem. I want him to be happy but I'm upset that he can do these things, which is shitty of me to even feel.

How do I get over it? How do you even make friends when you're just a piece of shit person with no good qualities? I'm tired of being so damn lonely. What's the point of doing things if I can't even share them? I love to read and write but I'm not even motivated to do those things because I can't talk about them to anyone.

I don't have the motivation to wake up in the morning for anything, as it all feels unnecessary and hopeless. There aren't even people I care for, not even my parents or something.

Most of this discussion will be off the top of my head and I'll be adding my own experiences.

To start, there are situations in life that we genuinely have absolutely no control over. I myself suffer from MDD and struggle with it on a daily basis. I take medication, I try and get out more, I see a therapist and I'm trying to find a job that would interest me. I'm constantly worried about my future and whether I want to continue or not. One thing that happens quite frequently is that I create non existent situations in my head which cause even more stress and anxiety. Once this cycle begins, it doesn't matter what it is, whether I have control over it or not, it's a nightmare to deal with this constant stress of anything that may happen. Why does this occur? Why are we as humans so unequipped to handle these challange? One could say the society we are surrounded by and what is expected of us causes a drastic change in the way we look, feel and think. To an extent this is true, but why is it so terribly exhausting and anxiety stricken to be able to even begin coping with what is going on around us. It's an obstacle I am incapable of clearing, I worry about anything and everything that involves me and those close to me. I'm consistently tired, in pain, anxious, worried and have had this heavy weight on my chest each and every minute of everyday for over 5 years. Nothing seems to change, I keep telling myself tomorrow will be different, I'll do this and that and it will all be better. But when the time comes.... I fall short, I let myself down, I let others down and most of all I continue the same cycle over and over again. Is this a situation or cycle I've made up to comfort myself as all I know is this feeling of dread and doubt and fear and anxiety, or does it truly exist and hinder me? Am I really my own worst enemy? Why am I constantly at war with myself? It feels like a never ending battle, I fight back, but I don't fight hard enough. Am I even capable of doing so?
Just what exactly is it that I'm waiting for... An idea, a person, an event or situation in my life? These consist of things I can and can't control... I feel as though I have no control over the majority of these things, which further pushes me to feel as though I have control over nothing. Why do we have to suffer the way we do? Why are our minds and body working against us? Is it not the job of our brain to keep us alive and well? It's supposed to keep us alive for as long as possible, and we even have built in ways of surviving dangerous situations, but when it comes down to the core of it, our brains are what control us. Our thoughts, our actions and feelings.... Yet its perfectly happy with the idea of us ending it...","Our control, our fear, our anxiety, our stress...

Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all.

965,"(tw for mentions of sexual (specifically CSA), physical, and emotional abuse, incest, suicidal ideation, abandonment, grief, parental loss, and harrassment. let me know if i need to add anymore)

not in the suicidal way (ok maybe a bit). i *LITERALLY* feel like it was against the universe for me to be born and now I'm living a waking nightmare due to going against nature

my dad almost got in a fatal crash years before i was born and my mom had multiple miscarriages before having me

i was born early and when they xrayed me (because i was having trouble breathing) my intestines were tied. i was quickly flown to another hospital and when they xrayed me again i was suddenly fine.

i think this was all a warning sign

here's why i think I'm cursed:

since then i have been sexually abused (exclusively by different family members), emotionally abused, physically abused, neglected, got ptsd from medical malpractice, been abandoned veryvery suddenly by multiple people i have known for years, diagnosed with over 6 different mental disorders (there's probably more waiting to be discovered as well), and lost my stepdad due to a fatal accident on Christmas day 2022. 

since then his entire family has been harrassing us and trying to take his dogs from us out of purely spite. his mom thinks my mom is at fault (he had 100% brain death and my mom gave them the ok to take him off the icu) and she admitted to my mom she's trying to make me more suicidal so that i kill myself not because she has anything against me personally, but because my death would destroy my mom.

all of the stuff i listed has taken place in a span of 9 years. each year i experienced an extreme traumatic event. I'm only 18. i never got to properly experience my teenage years.

other random stuff i need to get off my chest and that also make me feel like I've been cursed:

i have Premenstrual Dymorphic Disorder (PMDD). I consider it the worst out of all the other disorders i have. two weeks out of every month my body and brain torture me. when i was told at 16 im to young to legally have a hysterectomy (the only known cure for most pmdd patients) and i would have to try almost every medication for pmdd before a doctor would consider it i started sobbing. I'm still trying different medications. The current one isn't working well so far.

i also might have to leave the place I've lived for 9 years for another country within the next 2 due to the fact I'm trans and things have been feeling more unsafe in the US as of late. what's especially difficult (and the cherry on top) is that I'm autistic so even minor changes are REALLY really hard. i also have a lot of friends and a community here. it just seems the major life changes have just been ramping up lately. I've been experiencing psychotic episodes lately due to sheer stress.

basically I'm trying to say that whenever something good finally happens and i can rest for a second it gets taken away from me. i can't remember the last time my body wasn't slightly tense actually

i feel like i can't tell my mom or even my friends I've had for years anything. all this trauma has left me not knowing how to emotionally open up. i feel so isolated even in a room of people i love. I've recently become emotionally and mentally unstable with my personality, morals, and behavior completely shifting in a single second. I feel like i can't trust anyone. I feel out of control.

I feel like i have upset the universe with my existence.

(ps don't ask me how my intestines can tie and then untie themselves i genuinely don't know. that's just what I've been told by everyone that was there. also i hope I'm ok to post this here. if not please let me know and I'll take it down. apologies if I'm not very coherent. i hope you all have a good day💖)",I feel like I wasn't meant to be born (literally),1

Then when I hit 18 and was still alive I just did the bare minimum to stay afloat, I kept biding my time like that hoping I'd have a spontaneous heart attack or something because of how unhealthily I treat my body.

But yet I'm still here ... why? 

How come hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to live died at an early age, but I who want to die am still here when I've not taken care of myself in so long... why, why, why?

I don't understand why the world is doing this to me. Even though my thoughts of death have been pretty passive, it's not like they don't affect me at all.

All I asked for was a job that I don't hate, that pays me a wage to live on my own...back in my parents day it seemed like that was actually doable relatively easily from the stories they both tell. Why is that not the case anymore? Or is it just me?

Again I ask, if the world wants me to live so much, than why make it so goddamn hard to actually live???

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",1

I feel like everyone else is on a whole other plane of existence, meanwhile I’m stuck beneath the surface just trying to breathe. 

Every time I talk to someone, I have to check to see if there’s something on my face once I leave because other people don’t know what to say to me and it’s always so fucking awkward. I try so hard to appear normal, but other people see right through it. I can’t relate to anyone. I can’t talk to anyone. I try so hard but I just can’t.

And it’s embarrassing. I feel stupid for being this way. I’ve tried so hard to fix myself and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’ve been in therapy for over a decade and the only thing that’s changed is I’m really good at talking about myself.",Being Depressed is Embarrassing,1

981,"Never in a million years did I think I’d be on Reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain. I’ve been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late &amp; I feel like I’m just unable to get a grip on anything. 

1. My father passed away &amp; I hadn’t spoken to him in well over 10yrs prior to his passing. He was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed. I am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the “what if” things in relation to a better childhood.

2. I found out that my sister is not 100% my sister &amp; we don’t have the same father &amp; we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who I also don’t have the best relationship with. We did DNA tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now it’s a waiting game. I live in the same house as her &amp; have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis.

3. The girl I have been in a situation-ship doesn’t feel the same way I do about her. This one hurts me so much, honestly more in a sense than my dad passing. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends &amp; love one another. I never thought I’d catch feelings for her but here we are. We have a beautiful friendship , the sex is great &amp; we have so many great laughs &amp; moments. She’s been such a bright spot in my dark times lately. I wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesn’t feel how I do. This now is breaking my heart &amp; don’t know how to navigate it. I don’t want to just get rid of her as a friend, I genuinely care about her. She is fine with continuing what we are doing but I’m not sure I can do that right now with how I feel about her. 

Everything is just compounding ontop of eachother &amp; I feel like I’m suffocating. My appetite is shot, I feel restless where I feel like I’m going crazy &amp; I’ve been having very dark thoughts &amp; find humor in self harm jokes to myself &amp; my close friends. 

Maybe this is a cry for help, maybe I’m trying. I’m not sure. But if anyone reads this &amp; has advice or a heart to be here for me I would love &amp; cherish your kindness. Thank you .",Could really use someone to talk to. I’m falling apart,1

983,"I’m 40(M) and I’ve always maintained that I’m too ugly for women and that hasn’t changed.  Then my not long ago my therapist talked me into using a dating app to get experience to chatting with women and to get over fears of rejection.

I didn’t like the idea but I did it anyway.  Well I think it is fair to say that it was the final straw, because the only women who were (allegedly) interested were women in foreign countries, sure they were highly educated (they claimed) and quite a few of them were not bad looking but I zero matches from us women.

Long story short, I was talking to this female doctor in the Dominican Republic and most of our conversations had to be done with google translate because she didn’t speak much English.  Well after a while I realized that this was going nowhere and I politely told her that we needed to go our separate ways and unmatched her.

A few days later I decided that enough was enough, I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt that I’m too ugly and need to just embrace being alone for life.   But my brain won’t let me, I keep having to remind myself to not go back to the app, to just find ways to help people and be content alone but again my mind keeps obsessing about being alone so that I find myself needing to vent several times a day and it’s pathetic.

I cannot fucking believe that this is what life is, but I guess I just got unlucky.

We get left to rot in shitty minimum-wage jobs, ignored by all the girls or boys in school, treated like shit by everyone who was supposed to care about us. We get nothing and yet we’re expected to be grateful for a life empty of everything that makes it worth living. So I think I’m done with all of this nonsense.

Yesterday I went out with this great girl I met in university 2 years ago, which I've been texting on and off with. I thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out, but as I later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying.

987,"20M

I feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips; i cant remember much anymore, i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore; at least not the ones that ive done already (which is just about everything). I have all the desire in the world to get better, but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time, and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.

My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up, do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week, then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks, which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing, but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.

The thought that really bugs me the most, the reason for making this post in the first place, tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner, but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine, but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally, but during my episodes, they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up, everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend, and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends, and i always hated being alone, and i still do; which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore, im a completely different person than the one i used to know.

The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future, and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life, or if im going to feel happy and content ever again, or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually, and i cant feel like this forever, but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal, i dont have a desire to stop living, and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living, functioning person.

I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally, but im afraid of them.","my depression keeps getting worse, and i want to stop pushing away the people i love.",1

I am so exhausted. For as long as I can remember, probably from about 5 years old, I have been hideous. 

I was an extremely shy kid and had selective mutism, so I was always self conscious. I just can’t remember not being this way. When I started elementary school, kids would constantly comment on my looks. They compared me to skeletons, zombies, and dead bodies. The few friends I had were  told “Don’t be friends with her, she’s too ugly for you, you can do so much better.” I wasn’t allowed to sit with anyone in the cafeteria in middle school and I had to stay in the library away from everyone. People left notes in my locker calling me all sorts of names. In high school people just ignored me and I was so lonely. Then at home my parents would occasionally get angry and call me a lazy pig.

I know people have had it worse, so the worry of me being too dramatic makes it even more unbearable.

I’m going to graduate college soon. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship, any men have just taken advantage of me. However I am extremely lucky to have a few supportive friends who have tried to help me. 

Since less people actively hurt me nowadays, I expected this to get better. But if anything it’s getting worse. My nose is crooked, my lips are uneven, one of my eyes is smaller than the other. I have crooked teeth despite constantly wearing my retainer. My skin is horrible and I have this weird skin discolouration resembling a mustache that I have never been able to get rid of. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have been to therapy, I have tried body neutrality, meditation, anything you can think of. Nothing helps. I spend my days obsessing over my looks and my nights crying myself to sleep. I alternate between staring at myself for hours trying to figure out what I did to deserve to be this ugly, to having to shower in the dark and avoiding mirrors because I can’t stand to look at myself. It is utterly exhausting to hate myself this much. 

I know deep down looks aren’t everything. But being pretty would be so much easier. I don’t understand why I was dealt these cards, why I have these disgusting genes. I know other people suffer from this, but they all have redeeming qualities. I am a monster. And I need to be beautiful. I can’t stand anything else anymore.

Things like “you need to eat a cheeseburger” “well if you’d eat you’d gain weight” “your skinny as a pretzel” “skin and bones” “skeleton” etc etc. I could go on for days with the amount of things people have said about me being skinny. I’m over it. I have a super fast metabolism and I literally eat 3-5 meals plus snacks a day. I’m just so tired of being skinny and being shamed for it. I feel like a lump of bones with skin. At least people have convinced me that’s all I am…,Noodle arms 🫠 / Skinny Shaming,1
1006,"Hello

I've been having this issue for years now and it seems to make everything worse than it should be. 

I've been trying to reach out for help for 7 years now (I'm 21 now). I've been trying to tell my mom what's happening, telling her why I can't seem to get out of bed for days on end sometimes, telling her that I need help, and everytime the conversation happens it feels like she finally gets what I'm saying. She never does. Everytime she gets upset at me she asks why I'm always in bed, why a person my age is always tired and never really doing anything or going anywhere,  and Everytime it just makes me feel both worse and insane. I've straight up told her that I've thought/attempted suicide before and all she had to say was ""oh really?"" in a tone that suggested that I didn't have it hard enough to do that. 

I don't understand why she keeps doing this, why she keeps asking me what's wrong when I've told her a thousand times. It's making me feel like I'm making everything up, that I'm going crazy. If anyone went through something like this and has some tips or anything that could help, please please tell me. I don't know what to do at this point, I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.",Why can't my mom see that I'm depressed?,1

I  am taking Zoloft and nausea is pretty bad, even with the one half of 50  mg tablet. I dont know if switching SSRIs would be beneficial or this  side effect would remain the same?

What  is interesting is that I have taken Zoloft 15 yeras ago with absolutely  no issues at at all, and now I feel like I am taking a poison. I don't  understand this at all.

1008,"So, I can't anymore. I didn't think I would get here. I hope it won't be a long post. Thank you in advance.
F(26) I've always been the soul of the party, the kind of person you love to be around. Always joking, with super positive energy. Few people know what I'm like in my spare time, and that in fact there isn't a day when I don't wish to die.
If someone can understand that I feel alone since I was little. I have always sought to be seen, appreciated, respected.
My parents divorced when I was 5 years old. Since then, the relationship with my father has not been, because he is the most lying person I know. All my life he just promised me things and never kept his word. Now he has his family, which he does not take care of. Her children live with him, but they actually live like I did. My mother was always away in another country. He tried to compensate for the fact that all his life he ran after the perfect man and thus he neglected me. He never chose me. To want to move together to do something new 2. She chose men who, I'm sorry, did to her. And I had to grow up with my grandparents. With my grandfather always beating my grandmother. I saw all kinds of arguments, fights, scandals and everything that a child should not see. I always grew up with words like ""you're not good for anything, you don't know how to do anything, you're like my mom, you're like tactu"" My mother has 2 brothers, who are super narcissists. That they gave me a juice when I was younger ""they raised me"". Grandma raised the men of the family as if everything was theirs. And my mother and I always had to do everything. From food, cleaning, money... Everything. No, they are men and we are women. Ever since I was little, I used to fight with everyone, because I was always different. I don't consider that my purpose is to find a man, to have a child and that's...as my family wants. I always wanted more. Because of this, my jobs were not exactly easy either. I was a team leader at 19, and it still wasn't enough, although no one in the family did more than me...
My grandfather died 2 years ago, and since then the family fell apart even more. My mother left again to another country, after her boyfriend who is my age and treats her worse than anything.. and I stay at home with my grandmother, who is also mean.
I tried everything, to meditate, to go to a psychologist, to stop thinking about all the things. Anything...
I feel alone, abandoned. As everyone sees their life, I remain here behind, worthless, with nothing. I have nothing. Not a day goes by that I don't think I want to die... Thank you.",there is no day when I don't want to die,1

I keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for 2 years but it doesn't meet the criteria of PTSD, but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasn't consistent, actually most of the time I was treated better except for some situations that I keep remembering till now. 

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety, panic, ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) 

I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.

I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. 

So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. 

I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision.

1083,"I've been depressed for a few years now. I don't feel totally lost. Somewhere inside me, I still have hope, I still have a real belief that it's possible for me to feel normal and happy again. But there's a much stronger feeling, an overwhelmingly powerful one, that even if I *could* be happy again, I don't deserve it. I don't deserve support from others, I don't deserve to make small gains for myself. Every time I start to move in a positive direction, every time others give me advice and offer help, every time it seems like I'm finally digging myself out of the hole.... I stop myself. I hurt myself. I don't let myself get better, because I feel like I don't deserve to be better. 

I hate it. It feels totally inescapable. No matter what progress or advantage I'm giving, I end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away, because I can't escape the feeling that I deserve nothing but suffering, that it's an injustice to the world if I get better.

Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since.

1114," (not saying people here are fake but I’ve become more of a hermit). Want to move back home and pursue schooling/certification (medical billing and coding). Feeling insanely depressed here.

So I made the move out here last year 2 months before turning 29. 

At first I enjoyed it. I’m able to buy weed whenever I want, I get a better pay than I did back home, and I don’t feel like a child living at home. And the weather was pretty nice.

But over time, it started wearing on me. I miss my nieces and every time we’ve factimed they look so much older. I feel sad that I’m not there. I miss my family and our family dog. Also I ran out of my ADHD/anxiety/depression medications and haven’t tried finding a new psychiatrist/therapist because I don’t want to deal with the hassle of searching around. 

I feel like I haven’t really connected to anyone here. I thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday, that someone would recognize me and I’d make friends (which is what happened back home), but it hasn’t happened. I have no dating life at all. I get 3 or 4 days off a week and spend them alone. Sometimes I’ll game with my high school friends online, which is the only thing I really look forward to, but this fucks my sleep schedule even more.

I work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore. I try sleeping during the day but it’s difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud. Why don’t they just wear headphones?

My sleep schedule is shit. I hate going to run errands because I have to walk 15 minutes to my car. 

I snowboard for like 2 hours and then feel like going home because I get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines.

Once the season ends, they’ll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights, but then I’ll have to get a roommate. Having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and I don’t like it. No privacy at all.

When I go back home, I want to start regularly going to therapy again, but am thinking “how can I do that if I don’t have a job”. How do I ensure I have a job when I get back home?

I stress my husband out like no other. It can all be solved if I just leave. My husband asks where to? I don’t know, I have no one so probably the streets. Obviously he’s not ok with it but again better than subjecting everyone to this bs. It seems like a fair trade for a better life for them and I’m put out of my misery.

1119,"Throwaway because the people in this post have reddit accounts. I (28F) am married to a wonderful man (32M) let’s call him Mark. We have been married for 7 years now and I grew very close to his family as they live in the same city as us while my family is in another country.

His brother Maison (30M) and I grew very close and we have a great friendship, laughing together, talking about life, etc… as time went by I started noticing that i was being supportive and there for him and the opposite isnt true.

Now for a little backstory, Maison went through a very tough phase in his life and got depressed and suicidal, he went to therapy and started getting back on his feet again but he was never the same. This happened 3 years ago and after that experience he became very self-centered, inconsiderate yet very sensitive and also does not accept any type of criticism. He literally turned to a manchild. Only wants to game all day, doesnt help the people around him, is very dependent even in the smallest things. Mark is always walking on eggshells around him for this reason because he is scared that he would say / do anything that will cause Maison to relapse into depression.

I on the other hand am a little tougher on Maison. I sometimes feel like his family not saying anything when he is rude or acting like a child because they are afraid to hurt his feelings are turning him into a very immature and irresponsible man who is never held accountable.

He moved in to live with us temporarily to save some rent money till he gets his life together. He adopted a dog, and let her go because he didnt train her properly and she became aggressive with separation anxiety. Then he adopted another dog and the same thing happened again and he let him go. He wants so many things in his life but wouldnt want to put the hard work or the responsibility.

My question is, should we go easy on him because of his mental health? Or is going easy on him will make his life harder later because he will get used to life without any responsibility or accountability?",Are we Supportive or destructive,1

1124,"I’m on medication and i do all the things people recommend, i got a bike for university so that i’d stop being sedentary, i try to keep my room clean and i even force myself to go out with friends and socialize.

But i realized i don’t enjoy socialization, they say humans thrive on socialization, but I don’t feel that I do.

People feels like a chore for some reason I never really miss my friends or miss going out with them.
Every time they ask me to go out I make up an excuse and humor them and on the rare occasion i did go with them I would go home early. They will try to prolong the outing as much as possible. Maybe have a couple of drinks and play video games late into the night but I genuinely can’t find it in me to wanna be around them and it isn’t about them as people they’re actually very sweet and accepting wonderful people. 

They are kind hearted and patient and one of them even cooks for us sometimes it isn’t about them. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I just can never seem to enjoy being around people it’s supposed to be healing to be a part of a community to feel like you belong, to go out with friends and to get out of the slump you are in. 
 
A lot of people tell me it’s not good to lay in bed all day or to be in inside your apartment, watching YouTube and movies and playing video games alone but I genuinely feel that I don’t have the same functions that other humans do I don’t have the thing that makes me want to be around others. It just isn’t an emotionally fulfilling experience. 

I don’t feel the need to be around other people and whenever I do go out with people, I look forward to just going home and relaxing and finally breathing and doing whatever i want.
I’m not sure why maybe it’s a personality clash? Maybe I just haven’t found my “people“ or someone that really understands me to the point where I would find their company enjoyable? I’m not sure all I know is I’ve never really had a friend that I wanted to spend that much time with if it were up to me, I would go weeks maybe even months without ever hanging out with friends even though I know it might be better for me mentally if I’m around people and put myself out there and meet new people as well but I genuinely do not crave human presence in my life and the happiest or at least the most content I’ve ever been is when I’m alone reading comics and drinking coffee in my bed.

It isn’t like I don’t want to have friends I really do, when I have friends I just don’t really see their presence or company as a priority or a need in my life other than a conversation every now and then I never really seem to want to spend my free time on them.

Hi, idk if this is in the right place but I just need to get stuff out.
I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to. I want to be so capable and successful and hard working but I just want to kms anytime I think of getting up and going out.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

I can't drive, afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so I feel so lonely and depressed.

1143,"For as long as I can remember, I have always suffered from anxiety. Perhaps it runs in my family. Yet I was never able to name it or put a label on it. During COVID, it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage. For past half year, so much has happened in my life that I feel like I am living someone else's life. The only good thing that has come out of it, is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how I channel it. I am so heartbroken to see that I mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage. 

Anxiety builds up in me for various reasons. Sometimes, it is related to work, sometimes things not going my way, or sometimes pretty mundane things. It slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled. Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me. I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something. During COVID, the unfortunate victim became my spouse. I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time. So once I spoiled the mood around me, or picked up a fight, I would see that things are fucked up. I always blamed the spouse, work or boss for the fight or issues, yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments.

It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling. I feel so ashamed and resentful. The sad truth is that I don't see any quick remedy for this either. You see, there will always be some dormant resentments inside me. There are issues between me and my spouse, that we cannot agree on. There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc. And whenever anxiety builds up, it needs a channel for relief. I'm afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over.

I have come to this community to ask for your advice, that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time? I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive. I can't change my spouse, I can't get that promotion. But I can always put effort to find a new job, always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments. How does one make this change? How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too? I need some encouragement and guidance.

I submitted as part of my supporting evidence a short patient summary from my GP, my medication list (Inc up to date prescription repeats forms), letters from my therapist, letters from the police (involvement after S and severe SH), letters from my mental health team, letters from psych, and a letter from my GP detailing all above and support. 

I've heard nothing from ADP so today went to online chat and was told it's been picked up by a case manager (yay) , but that they've requested more SI from my GP. 

What?!?!?

What else could they need? And if they've requested that from GP it'll take months before I hear. It took my GP 5 months just to write the support letter they did write. 

So now I'm in an anxiety spiral because if they're gonna deny my claim I wish they would just fucking tell me instead of making me wait 6+months. All the while I can't afford my mortgage and I'm getting deeper and deeper in debt.

Some brief background info:
I have autism so I may not always understand all social cues. Neither my friend nor I live in the US.

I have a friend going through a hard time right now. He has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues. He's had depression before I even met him and have never seen him this low. He also has money problems and thus can't afford treatment for his physical issues atm. 

What's the best way to support him?
I cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 Whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. Whenever I talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that I'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". Whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. So he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

Yeah, withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.

Since I move around a lot I can't get a real attachment to anyone which is sad for me with the exception is my GF of 7 soon to be 8 years. But I lately I've begun to realize that I feel more comfortable being a depressed guy than happy, it's more like I rather be sad and tired so others can be happy. For example my gf's family have taken me in as their own even giving me the nickname ""Mikwap"" (mee-gwap) which roughly translated to home in our language. 

Anyways, I wouldn't say no to them when they asked something of me. Nothing too crazy, simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do, lend them money when they need, or drive 4+ hours for an event. There are more things. But I do stuff like this for my actual family too and it's making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me.

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me.

Since coming here I've only come to realize I'm not anything, my only reason to exist was to care for my mom and now that's gone there's no purpose for me. I'll never be normal like everyone else. Never fit in. Never be pretty or smart or liked. I'm just worthless now.

1199,"I’m a 22 year old male, I really can’t be bothered to let all this bullshit play out for the rest of my life.

My family is dead, or too abusive for me to risk speaking too. 

I have let countless opportunities get away from me and now my only skill is dishwashing and cooking, which I hate and I am forced to do it to survive and pay my rent.

I’m by no means physically attractive and constantly am told (subtly or not) that I am ugly. Really like my facial structure itself is terrible. I’m losing my hair at this early age, and have a gross and large surgery scar on my stomach. People look at me with disgust in public. I have such low self esteem I cannot ever stand up for myself and if I try I get laughed at. Constantly treated with no respect unless it’s sympathy or pity, and I’m very awkward and weird.

I always make mistakes, can’t handle myself under pressure, constantly miss things and can barely make life decisions on my own, which I’m forced to do because I don’t have anyone else. It’s like my brain is a level lower than everyone else’s. When I have a chat with people they can insult me and I don’t even realise because I am so slow until later and then I feel so upset and resentful.

I had a group of friends , they are all good looking and live at home with their parents so they are able to have so much money to party and hangout , as we’ve grown out of Highschool age they’ve seen as I’ve devolved and aged badly and how pathetic, spineless and valueless I really am. I feel like I’ve been exposed. Now I don’t get invited , and when I do occasionally see them for something I can afford , I am the pathetic butt of the joke.

I used to have girls interested with me , perhaps because I was younger and better looking and confident because I was unaware. Now I seriously have no chance .

I don’t know how to have social interactions anymore, and I always feel like I said the wrong thing, that I’m different from other people in a terrible way. 

Out of sync with life and destined to be one of the unfortunate disgusting underclass.

The only thing that stops me from ending it all is that I have a sister who is younger than me and I am quite close with. She is well put together and successful, and since she has no family either I know how much it’ll devastate her to lose me.

These days sometimes I think she would be fine though…

6,"i’m a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma, mom, uncle, aunt, and little sister.

my mom has a meth addiction and she’s developed schizophrenia from it and it’s been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think it’s schizophrenia. my mom doesn’t take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so (realistically she’s been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out) recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i don’t know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesn’t talk to anyone, sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room, but he doesn’t yell and scream like my mom does, he’s just very quiet and intense. 

so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead, and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because i’ve seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how  she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how she’s constantly was thinking about me and she doesn’t think i’m safe. so i looked and my aunt (she’s mentally well) sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. 

the message said “*uncles name* is acting strange again. i asked *moms name* if she did this and she said she didn’t. does *uncles name* know what it means to stab someone? that they will die?” in the photo my aunt sent my grandma, the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is i’m not sure if it’s a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it, so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didn’t really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea it’s probably not safe. 

i don’t know if it was my uncle or mom either though, if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot, and we would yell and scream at each other (we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen, then we moved, then we moved again and he moved back in with us) but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. he’s very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet, and i can tell he doesn’t like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. we’ve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and that’s about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i don’t think he would want to kill me. on the other hand it’s possible that my mom was lying to my aunt, but from what i’ve seen i don’t think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way it’s more of a “this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him” type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again, they are both schizophrenic which i really don’t know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so that’s why i’m asking. 

i know it’s weird to ask about this on reddit but i really don’t have anyone to talk to about it. i’m not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and he’s a big guy i just don’t want to i feel like it’d be worse, and i don’t want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. i’m going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i haven’t been able to since she’s been asleep all night, but she’s just going to ignore me after i express my concerns, which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though we’re not really too close but yeah. 

another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it, didn’t deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything, i don’t have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i don’t have a job right now since i’m a full time student and i just don’t know where i would go. i don’t have any friends that would let me live with them either so that’s out of the picture . the best thing i’m hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but that’ll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just don’t know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldn’t be worried or what i should do so yea pls help",I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me,4

13," I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical.

19,"Hello,

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",Some advice to my people,4

21,"Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.

28,"Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? 
I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

I'm not really sure how am I supposed to be awake I mean I'm unemployed still in hands of my parents and other family members who take care of me and understand my problems but how did you manage to stay awake without coffee or did coffee really help you without feeling weird all time while on meds?

40,"(Gonna be a little long, gonna rant a bit)

Little back story, 20-year-old male, no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..

Last year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 6-7 days a week, confidence was high, and not a care in the world. I would say around May, I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on, it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year, I felt so detached, fatigued, and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head, it doesn't hurt, I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her.  I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me, and I went down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosing by reading google (i know worst idea ever). I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from (I still belive this), I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January, I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academy-type class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine, didn't eat breakfast, but drank 180mg of caffeine (I usually have \~300mg a day). During the afternoon portion of the class, I felt this sense of impending doom, and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest.  For 2 hours my HR was in the \~130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER, My EKG came back normal, sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate). They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro, and man oh man, hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me, constant panic attacks, SOB, tingling, the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack, Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again (like driving) to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house, not stressed at all, then my heart rate will kick off to the \~120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L  theanine, Ashwagandha, and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal? Does it get better? will it be like this forever? how did you guys get over your anxiety? tips? medications? Thank you all for taking time and reading my post I really appreciate it. I just really need some help...",Anxiety has ruined my life... I need some advice/help,4

I don't see any actual black or decay, just an indent that was hiding behind some tartar, but everyone's always told me that once you can see a cavity it's already too far and the tooth usually needs to be pulled (might not be true, just what I've been told) 
     I'm hopefully going to make an appointment on Monday but I'm so nervous because my teeth are terrible. I don't have any missing or rotting teeth but I can never remember to brush them and I had hg a couple years ago that turned into a 3 year long problem of throwing up multiple times a day.

50,"At the time I was sober going on 18, 19 years. I was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. 

For the longest time, especially since sobriety, I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. 

But, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life.   


My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! 

I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia (Fredricksburg) I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. 

On down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. Overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose ""my concept"" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   


About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   


I did not think that way at first. At first I thought, ""I fucking hate everyone."" For a while. 

Then 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   


6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   


Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   


You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium.

71,"I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily.

72,"On the one hand, it’s comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people don’t even know I have anxiety. 

On the other hand, it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle, if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life, and it’s frustrating that no one knows how hard I’m trying. They just think this is easy for me, that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. That’s not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this, more that it’s just generally frustrating that people have no idea.

I’m 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. I’ve dated a lot over the past few years, but this is the first time in ages where I’ve REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them, and anxiety doesn’t play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed, and I’m getting crushed. 

Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me, obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning, freaking out if she’s doesn’t respond to my messages within a couple hours. It’s taking over my life. My work is slipping, I can’t sleep well, a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

It doesn’t help that she’s very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I don’t want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface I’ve been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on, because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.

77,"So the preface, I’m someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years, occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dad’s door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills, taxes, or myself, that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they can’t stop themselves, but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene, my mom did physically attack  me (I didn’t get hurt, I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me).

Last night, she called me to ask if I could knock on my dad’s door, since he wasn’t responding to her calls, because she “needed to pay a bill.” I knew that this wasn’t just about a bill, so I compromised and sent him a text instead, I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasn’t going to call him/wake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency, as I would consider it to be rude to do so. 

She then says “don’t worry your little head about, go back to sleep or whatever, okay?” 

Then, she called me again, this time saying “What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door.” I declined, saying I don’t want to be a part of whatever was going on between them, and she should talk to him about this, to which she said “I know. He’s your loving dad, and I’m the evil mom.” 

I said goodnight to her, she laughs and responded with “not goodnight. Good bye.” 

I say that I will talk to her tomorrow, and she replies “I’ll never talk to you again. Not tomorrow, not the next day, or the next.”

She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. 

She calls me one more time that night, here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door again:

“I ask you to do one simple thing, and you didn’t do it. It’s just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad, and he isn’t answering me. It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything! Translation: “Look at what I do for you! And yet, you can’t this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!”

“It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything!”

“You’re full of shit, just like him (my dad).”

“Where has your dad been all of your life?”

“You need to take responsibility.”

“Is this what one of your councilors told you to say, the one that I pay [x amount of money, I don’t exactly remember].”

“You don’t even know what is going on.”

“But fine. You can do whatever- go to sleep, wake up in the morning, do whatever you do.”

Me: “ok. Goodnight, mom.”

And finally, I said goodnight to her, and she said: “Don’t call me mom. Just say good night.”

That’s not to say my dads innocent either or anything - he’s hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well, so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically, they’re both each others abusers and victims, if that makes any sense at all. 

But I do believe he is the safer parent, as although he can, at his worst, make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him, as he is kind of an asshole at times, I don’t feel like my safety is threatened around him, unlike with my mom. He’s a lesser of two evils , if you will.

So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad, and my mom immediately associated me with him. So, now I’m afraid that when she comes home, she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad, or worse. I’m afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically.

I don’t have this fear around anyone else (I couldn’t care less what anyone else thinks of me) but for some reason I have it with her. I’m not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity. I’m talking about bigger things like hair dye, piercings, or really anything to do with clothing. For example, recently I worked up the confident to ask her over text if I could dye my hair, which she is fine with, however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what I want, I chickened out and got to scared to show her.  It’s like I knew she would say yes, but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid she’d say something judgmental to me.

Hey r/anxiety, 

I am in a very tough spot rn, i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years, started my teaching certification programme (in my country you need to do this), but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain, diarrhea, insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job (like a 10 h job) in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services (the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me).
I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies (tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them, if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them, my divorced father had to pay me 112 € a month for instance) and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.
Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library (smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly) as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying, shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. 

As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days, i have lost 3 kg of weight, lack any appetite, have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country (we are in EU so travelling is no problem). I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it (i was paying my fam 250 € a month from the teacher pay), so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. 
I have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.

Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?

What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check",27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life,4

I’ll start with some context. I’ve always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous.

I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.

This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines.

Then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work. I don't like to talk much while I'm working because I feel like I mess up more when I do. So I began to feel anxious about being around him since I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other.

Then, a few days ago, he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working. I had a bad experience the last time I gave my number out to someone (the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we weren't, wouldn't stop calling me, tried to turn me against my family, etc.) and I immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we don't know each other at all. It felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me. I told him that we were busy and shouldn't be having that conversation right then (mainly because I didn't know how to say no in the moment) and that we could talk when we were done helping customers. But he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so. He ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me, telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off (this is while I was talking to a customer). Once we were done with all of the customers, I told him the truth: that I didn't want to give him my number and how I had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy I barely knew. He seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day. So I thought everything was going to be fine.

However, the next day, I started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me. He wouldn't be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible. He has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like he's supposed to; he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately. I often notice him watching me from across the room. Every conversation we have is awkward. I don't initiate them because I want him to leave me alone so I can work. When he's not talking to me, it seems like he isn't really talking to our other coworkers that much.

But then, the other day, I had a bit of a scary experience. I was going on break and went to our break room. He was in there and had headphones in, so I didn't think he saw me. After a few minutes, I went to the bathroom across the hall. When I came out a few minutes later, the room was empty.  I suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room, half-yelling my name just to show me a song from the 1800s for some reason. I'm worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me, which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now. I don't like being alone with him. Today, I spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom, worried he might bother me if I went anywhere else.

I know that the anxiety I feel isn't healthy, and I can't tell if I'm just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here. I don't know if I should talk to him, a manager, or HR about this. I thought that maybe I should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone, but I'm worried that it could just make things worse. I could really use some advice if anyone has some. Because I really can't tell if he's just trying to be friendly and doesn't realize he's making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on.",I am feeling anxious about a new coworker.

102,"I (17F) am in my senior year of high school. I’ve sort of always been anxious, especially about people. Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about, even a little bit, I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. 

So, as I said, in high school. When I first started high school, life was a mess. What’s important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family, but that’s okay.

In my particular HS, we have a home room class, and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher, she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years, she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday, talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time, and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. 

This week, she’s been absent. Very strange. Then, on Wednesday, she says in a slide prepared for the sub that she’s out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasn’t planned, you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. 

I find out that she’s in the hospital, but fine. INSTANTLY, I’m full of anxiety, feeling like my soul was removed from my body. I’m just worried, like, a lot. I KNOW she’s fine, as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a “Get Well Soon” card, being given to her by another teacher she’s friends with. I don’t really know how to just patiently wait for the 3-4 weeks until she gets back. 

I’d also like to say that I KNOW she’s fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way, especially when I’m not actively doing something distracting.

TL;DR my teacher is sick and in the hospital and I have a strangely large amount of anxiety, even though everyone says she’s fine.",I am having a extremely large amounts of anxiety for a person.,4

104,"I (23F)  have a pretty okay relationship with my boyfriend's (24M) family. His mom is a devote Christian and her and  I are pretty close and his brother (let's call him Jake) and I are okay as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact (liking stories, pics,etc). Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know (crazy I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music, middle fingers in pictures, etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought, does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do.

108,"6 to 7 years ago I was diagnosed with GAD/PTSD. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I have managed it all this time with no medicine, and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn’t manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. 

Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine  for “as needed dosage” 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. I’m not scared to take meds again. 

This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However, I’m now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle.

113,"Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.",Actually you're a total badass,4

im also on a birth control to manage my periods (its called ""Evalyn"", i think im spelling it right, idk the science medication name off the top of my head though) but i know i can take pain killers with my BC. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol.

would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not (using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safe)

130,"Hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. After developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout, I mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes I get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest, I quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel well-prepared to take head-on, especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before, but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy, panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.

Specifically, I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fight/flight responses around takeoff and aviophobia, or *fears when the plane is in the air.* I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. 

But as I lay on my side writing this, I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.

I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10-minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.

It's crazy, I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. 

I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight, to sleep, to cry, to indulge in self-hatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now, but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today, because it was not going to get done. 

I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle, but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear it.

I still want to fly, deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.",Anticipatory anxiety ruined my chance at a vacation. I'm so tired of trying to fly and failing.,4
135,"I (24M) have been dealing with anxiety and treatment resistant depression for the past few years or so. It’s gotten very bad and my mental health has deteriorated as the days go on. I’ve started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and it’s really freaked me out lately. I’ve been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.

The past few months have been hell, dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues, and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. I’m surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable, talking to a different guy every night and most nights she’s going out. Now this probably wouldn’t bother me but when I have so much going on, sometimes I just need someone to talk to. 

I was always extremely close to my mom, she has always been there for me but lately she really doesn’t even seem to care. Her only worry is that “I’m afraid you’re going to hurt yourself” but she doesn’t want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and I’m so hurt. I’ve lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.

I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house, I workout so it’s not like I’m just sitting at home waiting for her.

So my country is going to have an election in the fall. Politics used to stress me out much more in the past; I've since then cut a lot of the sites that were stressing me out and most days, I feel pretty good and don't really worry about it that much. My country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now- I'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments, blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. They've started to rule when I was a teen, and I'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. It seems like they will win this year again, and another, even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.

I fell into a mental hole and I can't get out of it. I know that the elections will be in the fall and it's early spring, but I just feel so depressed and powerless. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to and that it will always just be horrible.

148,"Disclaimer, the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but I want to share this on many threads in order to get some help.   


I'm M 33years old:

[What's really interesting is, every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones I I have right now, so if you can please check them out so you understand what I am going trough.](https://www.reddit.com/r/costochondritis/comments/jrihv6/chest_pain_for_months_no_answers/?xpromo_edp=enabled)   


The only logical explanation I've found myself is, that it might be severe Anxiety or Burnout I've experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress.

As well some people, from what I've googled, claim that it might be side effect after a COVID infection (around June 2022), but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick (I got headaches and my throat hurt, her throat hurt and she was tired, both of us were 3x vaccinated). The only reason why I rule it out, is because these pains did start 2 days after my bed broke down while I was lying on it (August 2022) and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october 2022 but we've slept on the couch (that can be transformed into a bed) which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue (had a ""hole"" in the middle so had to change it) for almost 3 months.

Before this all happend, I was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and I was inactive during the lock down (2020) and after losing my job (june 2021), I've been almost every day on the PC (with bad posture probably) from 2019 - June 2022. (I got now a new job in september 2022 but got laid off from a previous one I was in for 3 months around January 2022)

Also I was on Amitriptyline 25mg for almost a year, and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than (June 2022), I used to have around 2021 iirc similar pains/tingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones I have right now.

I do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better, beside accepting our symptoms and live with them.  


I have the typical tingly, electric feelings around my left side, headaches, migraines, heart races, burning/cold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when I feel really anxious.  


Now all the symptoms seems to focus on Chest/Pain/Neck Pain with Brain Fog with, especially when the pains are strong.

  
The only relief I've found was lying down (tough sometimes I had moment where my back was blocked/stiffed but just for a short time and after I moved a bit), taking walks outside in the fresh air, being distracted, doing some stretching of the muscle where I have the pain.  


Yet what I hate is they all return.  
I've did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many Doctors, ER etc:  
dozens of Bloodtest came fine, have a slight Arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck (nothing seriously according to the doctors), Neurologe didn't found any anomaly, Cardio doctor in August/September 2022 told me my heart is totally fine (we did a stress test on a bike)   


So in the end, I really hope it's just my anxiety/burnout, as my doctors all say, who gave me all these physical symptoms. All I want is that these pains finally stop! And if I did write many confusing things, please tell me so I can clear it up.

So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before.

I’ve wanted to become a director for years now. As you’d imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I’ve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I’m a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I’ve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can’t see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you’re aware of the John Wick films, you know that they’re probably the most “foot on the gas” and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I’ve never had to leave the cinema. I’m pretty uncomfortable being there but I’ve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it.

I felt unbelievably great as I increased the dose. I took notes on my experience and I was just saying how great I felt and how I had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.

Antidepressants have been in use for a while now so I'm sure there's some wisdom about (1) whether being happy like that is sustainable, (2) whether it's healthy or not, and (3) whether I could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the ""dose ladder"" and gotten the effect to ""stick"".

Most importantly, when the ""happy"" effect was in place all my ADHD medications were working. This was absolutely life-changing. I can read in my notes that it says over and over ""if I could only maintain this level of healthy brain-functioning and ADHD-medication effectiveness then I would have a great life"". I wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that I had with the escitalopram and the ADHD medications; maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my ADHD medications.

I've been dealing with my anxiety since I was 17. Since then, I've been looking for ""triggers"" that makes me feel more anxious. Like a pattern. So I could deal better with it (I dont have any pro help). I've realized that my anxiety gets worse when I have to talk with people. So, I've been trying to better my communication. And Im better, actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. 

But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason, when I see them or talk with, I have a bad feeling, a heavy energy, and my anxiety explodes. Because of that, I cant trust on them. And I'm always in the ""alert mode"" when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.

That's why i'm here. I'm trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them. Anyone feels like this around some people?

179,"I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders?  

I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a ""money induced paralysis"". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/v4qq6k/discussion_lack_of_motivation_induced_by_lack_of/) thread.  

It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort.  

I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind.  

I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?",How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome?,4

For roughly 5 years since, I basically jumped from one seasonal job to another. Then last year, I found myself being rehired in the same position, but this time the place is under new management. And honestly, I’ve loved it. Not only is a job I enjoy with a salary that is better than I would have initially expected, but it also allowed me to make awesome new friends and get reacquainted with old ones. But since the start of the holiday season, I’ve been off duty so to speak until the dining room opens back up in May. I’ve recently found out in the company group chat that it will open up on Mother’s Day weekend, to which I responded roughly with “awesome. So I guess that will be roughly when I’m coming back?” That was 2 days ago and since then the group chat had been dead silent. I’d assume it was cause everyone was busy and didn’t see, but the chat says that pretty much everyone saw it. And now it’s starting to feel similar to when I got laid off when I first worked there. And I don’t know why I would be since pretty much everyone has said how awesome I am for how hard I work and how good I am at my job. So, considering that, I may not have anything to worry about. But the fact that everyone saw that specific message yet didn’t say anything in response feels suspicious at the very least. What should I do? Do I have reason to worry or am I just worrying too much about nothing?",Something familiar started popping up in regards to work and it’s got me worried,4

221,I (F18) have been given the diagnosis of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. I am in a constant state of fight or flight and I’ve never been in this much pain in my life. It’s the kind of pain people kill themselves from. I am constantly shaking and throwing up. This constant stress has given me the diagnosis of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I had to go to multiple doctors as IBS is hard to diagnose. The stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically I’m constantly in both mental and physical pain. However I believe it goes deeper than GAD. It doesn’t stop. It’s not attacks either it doesn’t come or go.. it stays. I’ve taken benzos and they don’t do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. I wish I could be sedated so I don’t have to be awake and in pain. There have been a few incidents where I had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. Luckily I found lamictal and it has saved my life. I honestly don’t think I would be alive today if it hadn’t been for modern medicine. But this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. I’m thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and I have to increase my dose every couple of weeks. I couldn’t get a therapy appointment scheduled until late June so I’m kinda fucked.,Looking for perspective,4
222,"I really don’t like driving and honestly i really don’t need to drive either at the moment. I have had lessons in an manual this recently switched to automatic. I not a great driver either, I get too close to the pavement and don’t like going fast. When its focusing on parking I’m less stressed out, as it’s an empty car park. 

I guess I don’t like having to concentrate and although there is less to concentrate on with an automatic I still don’t like it. When I’m a passenger unless it’s like a short trip I’m asleep or if it’s short I am looking around or checking my phone.

Went on much faster roads and lots of roundabouts, accidental knocked a curb and someone on a roundabout in the left lane decided to give way to a truck waiting on the left while I was also on the roundabout in the right lane.

Been having like 1.5 hour lessons and although I make sure that I don’t have much to drink before hand and go to the bathroom twice before my lesson. There is always anxiety and I’m either running from the car or very unfortunately last week was at the lights and far from being able to leave the car and I’m still mortified. And canceled by next lesson and wanting them to just keep the money for the one other lesson I prepaid for. I just really don’t want to see the instructor ever again. 

If it were up to me I wouldn’t continue driving lessons because I don’t like it and I don’t need to. I am very happy walking or getting the bus. But my parents don’t understand that I really don’t want to drive.",Driving lessons,4
223,"I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore, and it's a vicious cycle. And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember.  I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me. 

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.

If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.",Can someone relate to this or have I broken myself?,4

I think my main regret with bringing it up is I feel like therapists don’t see me as reliable anymore. which is really funny because I consume a very small amount of edibles about two-three times a mo. and i don’t drink alcohol or use any other substances. but I can see it on their face that they don’t believe me. it seems like a catch 22. does it even help to be honest?",talking weed use with therapist,4

 I have a crush on a girl. My brother is friend's with her brother. My brother and her are also friends and seem to talk often. 

She had a crush on and liked my brother at some point, maybe she still does, I have no idea. 

Sadly, we never really talk or anything, especially outside of social gatherings where the whole ""group"" is already hanging out. I spoke directly to her, and vice versa a handful of times yesterday while we were all hanging out. 

It was kind of me just speaking for the sake of speaking, I didn't go out of my way to do it too much though because I was very anxious, nervous, and insecure around her.

Anyway, we've never interacted on social media, and she hasn't followed me or anything even though she probably knows that I have some social media accounts, for example, on Twitter she has most likely seen me reply to my brother's tweets.

Am I just being childish and over-analyzing social media?

I'm afraid she thinks I dislike her, and or dislikes me.

246,"I have been on antidepressants since the age 15. I have severe anxiety that sometimes leads to anxiety attacks. In the past few months…. 1) I hit a deer equaling $4000 worth of damage with a $2000 deductible; 2) I used all my sick days at work; 3) my psychiatrist quit and I wasn’t able to get my Zoloft or adhd meds filled; 4) an electrical panel in my car stopped working; 5) I paid almost $200 for a rental car while mine was in the shop and I couldn’t even use it the first day because it wouldn’t make it up my icy driveway, causing me to be late for work. 

It was that day I decided to go to my usual walk in clinic to see if they could call me in Zoloft because I was having a hard time getting out of bed. See, your body can’t stay in fight or flight mode indefinitely (which is what anxiety is) so eventually it has to shut down (depression). I get there and they tell me I have to have an appointment. That was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back. I began crying and hyperventilating. It was one of my worst panic attacks ever. Part of me was concerned they were going to have me committed. They were able to call in a 30 day supply and made me a follow up appointment. Which was today.

And they remembered my scene. So obviously my erratic behavior is because I’m a drug addict. I never once had to take a drug test to get my adhd meds with my old psych. This time they asked me to pee in a cup. I have anxiety so of course my first thought was that they thought I was bonkers the other day, but I had nothing to hide so I obliged. When I got home I got a call saying they couldn’t call in my meds because I tested positive for opiates. Excuse me? That’s IMPOSSIBLE. They said I would need to bring in a prescription to explain the reason I failed. I said I hadn’t taken anything, and that I could now care less about my medicine but this needed fixed to clear my name. They said they could send it off to the lab, and I said YES YOU BETTER DO THAT! Yes, I am still being emotional and irrational at this point. Not because of what they are accusing me but because my seratonin and dopamine receptors DO NOT WORK like they should…which is the reason I was going there for help. Instead, they decide to bring a devastating accusation against a person with emotional dysregulation (ADHD) and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder). It is negligence. What if this behavior caused a person to harm themselves? Do no harm. The way in which they handled this was very harmful. Almost as if they have no training on how to handle delicate individual (which medical personnel should). 

I did some research and guess what….poppy seeds! I just made a batch of lemon poppy muffins the day before yesterday. Surely the lab will be able to differentiate between poppy seeds and an actual drug, right??? It’s a small town and I KNOW they will break patient confidentiality because I’m a teacher…I just know it…I’ve had soMe of their kids in class. Of course they will tell other parents.

252,"Hi all,

I never struggled with anxiety like this before, when suddenly I had a panic attack for the first time last month - I felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and ""trapped/unsafe"" in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time I was still thinking rationally. But the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then I've been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightness/pain in the chest/stomach. 

These originally happened whenever I thought any remotely negative thought at all, but now they're just popping up at random times. Currently I'm sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like I'm about to cry for absolutely no reason at all. I wouldn't say I'm very worried about anything in particular (just the normal things I've been a little stressed about my whole life, like school) but it's getting really annoying to have these small (or on occasion, full-blown) anxiety attacks nearly every day.

I'm prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms don't seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and I feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life?

I have HA and one of my worst fears came true. My bf found out he has a rare genetic disorder that has a 50% chance to be inherited. 

We're commited and planning kids in the future. I freak out over a fuckin cough and this is driving me crazy. 

For me, the worst part is that my boyfriend is an absolute flegmatic and works on ""don't think about what you can't solve"" approach. I almost broke down when he brought the results home and he was just like... ""We'll see what to do when it happens, it's not like there's something we can do about it"" and then I saw in the report that they offered him an assisted reproduction option when we'll want kids and asked him if he'll want to go down that route and he said ""Dunno"" and it was obvious that he's not too excited about it"". But, like, how can you even THINK about risking 50% chance of it being inherited by our child??? It drives me absolutely bonkers. Why would you even be willing to RISK it when there is way safe option that is not that natural but would ensure that we'll have a thriving, healthy baby? And especially when the other alternative is pretty miserable, both physically and mentally?

We've been together for years and at this point I know him. I know he only seems to not care because he has a hard time explaining and showing his emotions. I also know I am being terribly, terribly unfair towards him for feeling frustrated at him. He just found out something so crucial! He needs time and space to deal with it and he needs my support. Instead I am the one demanding emotional support from him (I am demanding it only here don't worry, I don't plan to freak out on him while he's going through this). I don't understand why I am being so selfish when usually I put others first automatically.

But most stress inducing thing about it is, he mentioned some of my health issues to the genetic center and now they want to see me too because they have ""a small suspicion"" that there might be something from my side too. Of course, I googled the signs of what he has and, well, I am not surprised they want to see me, I check all the boxes, even skeletal malformation.

What's keeping me sane is the knowledge that the disorder is incredibly rare and that neither of my siblings show any (obvious) signs of it. That in itself should logically be enough to reassure me that I am FINE, but my brain refuses to accept it. I feel like someone took me, stuffed me into a washing machine and turned on a turbo wash. And I want to scream.

23 y.o. male at time of accident

NYE 2012. I smoked a blunt for the first time, and (the equivalent of) overdosed. Legs felt weak, had to sit down.

I smoked it in at the bottom of my road, so I sat down on a neighbour so outside wall (roughly 4ft high). Next thing I knew I woke up on the pavement looking up. I later found out from friends that were with me that I had fallen head first onto the concrete sidewalk, from about 4 ft high. I am 99.999999% I had a concussion. 

Anyway, next day, all was fine - no anxiety. Obvious scars and bloody face but nothing else. 

About two weeks later, I decide to play soccer with friends. The ball hit the back of head from behind. I immediately fell to my knees, and from what I remember, was dizzy etc. then it kind of just went. 

15 mins later, we left and had a short walk to the local restaurant. Half way there, I had immense lain in my stomach and groin area. I fell to my knees again on the sidewalk near the restaurant. I then managed to walk to the restaurant and immediately went into the toilet. 

I felt sick, anxious, weird, nauseous, etc. then, cur my first panic attack. 

Even since then, a whole 12 years, I had had Generalized Anxiety Disorder (diagnosed 2013). 

How does that even happen? I don’t understand how hitting my head would cause that? Did I accidentally damage my amygdala/hippocampus when falling?

Thanks.",Can having a concussion cause severe GAD?,4
258,"Hello.

For about a year, I've been having these obsessive thoughts about the past, all the ways I've messed up and things I did wrong. It's kinda ridiculous; I worry about things that happened 10 od so years ago, and I was just a kid back then, only about 12. I think about newer things too, but especially back then, I was cringy and mean to others for no reason (I didn't like the band that they did. I never bullied them, but I would kinda laugh at them and point out that they're being pandered to. Now I would just turn away and ignore them, I don't know what was up with me back then. To my defense I was almost always the youngest of the group, surrounded by people who were 14-16, from both sides). 

I feel like I'm a terrible human being and that I will be punished for them any day now; I don't know how exactly, by some external force that will come from outside of my home. I'm afraid that people who know me now and are my friends or people I'll meet in the future will judge me so hard and turn away from me. I've deleted every old social media account I could remember, I still make sure that my old emails are active so that I could delete any more if I'll remember. I'm on pretty heavy medications (antidepressants, three doses of synthetic pregabalin and an antipsychotic to quell my anxiety further), and I can function well, but these thoughts still come to me randomly and make me anxious. 

I don't know what to do anymore; My biggest wish is to just move on from that period of my life and close this chapter. On one hand, if someone came to me with thoughts like these, I would tell them that it was so long ago, and they have likely very little to do with the person they were at 13; Besides, everyone was a bit of a little shit at that age. But for some reason, when it comes to me, I just can't free myself; When I get scared, I feel like an ensnared wikd animal, only the snare is just in my head.

260,"So I just spent a bunch of money on video games (the online store for the Nintendo 3DS and WiiU is closing soon and I wanted to get a bunch of games before they’re gone forever). I could afford this purchase and I still have plenty of money in my bank account, but I can’t shake this feeling of guilt in the pit of my stomach. It’s like there’s this voice in the back of my head calling me an idiot for spending so much money on video games when I could be saving it for emergencies. It’s not just with big purchases either, I still get this feeling whenever I buy a $10 lunch too. 

I think this whole thing started when I was around 5. I was at the store with my parents and I wanted to buy a toy, but my mom said something about how we didn’t have the money for toys. I, being the stupid kid that I was, interpreted this as “we don’t have a lot of money” and that the family was one bad financial decision away from poverty. Of course this was not the case but that didn’t stop me from feeling guilty about making my parents spend money on me.and that guilt has followed me even now when I’m making my own money.

I can’t even do simple tasks in peace.

266,"Before anyone reads, I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack so everything in this post is everywhere and some words may be misspelled.

I think I know why too because the last time it happened I ate food that caused me to have a previous anxiety attack.

After I finish this I'm going to get some sleep so I will read any comments and make the necessary corrections to this post in the morning.

So anyway. I went across the street from work today to get some food from this ""chicken spot"" called Kennedy Chicken, I live in NYC, they're on every corner.

ALL of their food is super duper unhealthy. It's all deep fried foods. Chicken and mozzarella sticks is what I ate. They even gave me spoiled marinara sauce which I didn't eat because I noticed as soon as I opened the sauce container, the air pressure made the sauce fly everywhere on my hands and there were bubbles in it. I smelled it and it had an obvious spoiled smell to it like fermented tomatoes. 😖 I'm never eating from there again. EVER! And honestly I don't know how they're even still open.

It has been a while since I ate their food until today.

I've been trying to eat healthier foods. Even if I have to order out on days I don't pack my lunch at home, I choose a healthier option.

OR!!.. or..

It could be that I haven't been getting enough sleep since Monday. And everytime I feel the palpitations coming on, I always go to sleep and the next morning I feel better.

I've been to the ER multiple times for palpitations and they tell me it's due to stress and not enough sleep.

I work a full time job and I used up all my pto so it's difficult for me to take a day or two off for myself.

*figuratively rips hair out*

I hate working full time and I think I'm about to make a big sacrifice and go part time. Or maybe I just need to ride it out... I have so many financial issues right now that I can't do this anymore.

I want to move back home with my family.. but I don't have a car... I don't have money.... I need to buy at least a month's worth of food for 1 person (me) so I don't have to order out.

I don't have any idea how I've come this far and haven't ended up homeless.

At this point I'm rambling and I need a hug... but these are things I'm dealing with at the moment.

That food honestly tasted horrible though. 😕 I'm betting on my palpitations being caused by both lack of sleep and the fast food though.

I wish there was a way to get my rent lowered so that I can afford to pay all my bills properly... I might talk to my roommate about it and see what she says.

Okay.. if I have anything else left to talk about I'll make another post.

267,"Anything that will alter/change my life in some way gives me anxiety.
Examples 
7-years ago my bf(now husband) and I bought a dog. I cried and cried the first night we got him because i was soo scared of having totake care of anything else besides me. A few weeks later, the anxiety disappeared. I absolutely love my dog.
7-years ago i left my first job after being there for 5 years. I cried and cried. Had so much anxiety leading up to the new interview. Had ssoo much anxiety after being told i was hired. I was terrified of failing, not being able to pay my bills. So much so, that i asked for my job back. But was ghosted because they were upset i had quit in the first place. 7 years later still at this (new)job, its consistent, i make money. I feel secure. And glad i left the place prior.
3years ago i got engaged but wasn’t anxious about anything. Because we halted planning a wedding to buy a house
2 years ago my fiancé and i bought a house. It was fun leading up to the week before closing. The day before i was crying, anxious, scared. I felt like iwas making a mistake. What if we lose the house? What if something happens and we cant afford it because we have a mortgage now. I was fine after a couple days. Im sssoo happy in my home.
8 months ago, i got married. For the 3/4 months leading up to the wedding, i had horrible anxiety. Every single night id have lingering anxiety, some nights better than others, but always there. 
The week before the wedding i was a mess, scared of being married, scared of the change. But i am ssoo in love with my fiancé, he is my everything. I couldn’t understand the anxiety because i was happy! The day of the wedding i was emotion filled, i couldnt talk to anyone while getting ready, i was a nervous wreck. Once we left the church i felt ssooo different! I was actually FEELING how i felt. Happy, excited, in love. Not anxious. The reception was amazing! Im soo happy!

Now-im 29, husband is 30. We are talking about kids. I want them, but im sssooo afraid of the anxiety i know ill have. Im scared of the pregnancy, what if i have a difficult time, what if im anxious like i was for the wedding for all 9months? Im soo scared of giving birth, of the potential postpartum depression, me not connecting. Or what if i dont connect with baby? Idk im already anxious thinking about having an approximate date to get off birth control. Im scared. I brought up adoption but i hate the fact that id rather chose adoption JUST because of the anxiety. I know ill deal with it when the time comes closer to adopt. But it wont be 9months.

Life just feels so unfair sometimes. Like I’m having to work twice as hard as other people in my life and I’m just drowning. But when I complain or ask for help, people brush me off or call me over dramatic. Meanwhile everyone is always expecting me to play superhero for them in their own lives.

299,"TW: discussion of anxiety symptoms 

Some context: I’ve struggled with anxiety for a few years (but can remember symptoms cropping up at moments throughout my life) - I think it’s GAD as I’m mostly anxious about being anxious at this point. 
Does anyone else find it hard to ask for help? when I’m stressed by general life things (job pressures etc), it does cause me to be anxious, but I hate telling people how I feel because I don’t want to burden them or upset them. I also don’t even think of asking for help, until I’m in a bad place and really need it. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this?",I find it hard to ask for help,4
300,"I was diagnosed with GAD three years ago, but have declined treatment in the form of long term medicine (probably due to my medical anxiety, go figure). I would describe my attacks as completely random and not stemming from outside situations (typically). For instance, i will be laying in bed watching a funny show and suddenly feel like an elephant is on my chest. 
Two weeks ago i found a man hiding under my car in my driveway. I chased him off and called the police. Turns out he crashed his car up the road and was hiding from the police. I was worked up that day and the next, but have been able to feel comfort knowing this wasn’t some weird, targeted attack on me. But a desperate man in desperate times, or however the saying goes lol.
However, my physical symptoms have not left. My chest constantly feels heavy and i cannot get a good breath. I almost have to force myself to yawn to feel like im getting that “deep breath.” It’s affecting my life, mostly limiting my physical movements and causing headaches, assuming from constantly forcing a deep breath. I don’t have a pcp i can call for advice. But I feel like enough is enough and i would like to be able to breathe normally again. My mom has copd so I have a pulse ox around and my oxygen has been consistent at 98/99, so i can (mostly) confidently say this is anxiety. 
My issue is, do i call a doctors office and wait weeks to be seen? Or go to an urgent care, pay $150 for them to tell me this is just anxiety?

Over the years i went to therapy and even overcame (mostly at least) my health anxiety. 
To a point that both my psychiatrist (psychotherapist? Imho not sure, English isn’t my first language) and I felt as if could go back to going to a psychologist. Everything has been going okay, i kept eating well, i exercise regularly (4/5 times x week at the gym, walks with my dog, and i try to walk around as much as i can other than my commute to work, not 10k steps on most days, but i try to stay active) 

I have been on medications. I used xanax regularly and then started using it only if needed. Once these panic attacks began, i decided to switch to diazepam, since the xanax was making me very sleepy without helping too much with the anxiety. That didn’t help. 

I started having panic attacks/adrenaline rushes for every minor incident or event. 5 mins late for a meetup/reservation? High heart rate, anxiety all the usual. Calling a client on the phone and telling them they’ll have to pay xx amount? Same result. Everything minor sends me towards a panic attack/adrenaline rush. Even weed, which i smoked probably once per week on a friday evening started giving me horrible panic attacks, even if wasn’t still high yet.

331,"Hi all,

I hope I could get some opinions from the kind followers of this subreddit!

For as long as I (27 M) could remember I had pretty intense anxiety. As a result I overthink and self-sabotage a lot. About 2.5 months ago I got into a relationship with a phenomenal woman (21F). She’s so driven, smart, witty and funny and at first, I was sure that she was absolutely gorgeous. However, these past few days I’ve been wondering if I truly am attracted to her. I know this is weird, but when i look at pictures of her I find myself analyzing her facial features without even realizing it. I am constantly quizzing myself on whether I like her or not. 

This isn’t the first time it has happened. I remember the first time I went on vacation with my one and only ex I suddenly started to hyper fixate on each of her features and started to see her “differently,” if that makes any sense. Instead of seeing a coherent face, i saw a collection of facial features. Her nose seemingly looked larger, and the proportions were all off. Again, I know this sounds so weird. I pushed those thoughts aside and eventually got over it (she broke up with me for a completely unrelated reason).

I’m wondering if anyone has been through this as well? Part of me thinks I’m shallow for worrying about this. But part of me wonders if it’s the anxiety that’s causing this.

337,It’s been almost two years living trying to manage health anxiety and almost nothing that I try is working. I’ve been on anxiety medication for three months and thinking I was only gonna need It for 3 months I have actually increased the dose and want to be in It longer. I learn a lot in therapy but always fail to incorporate any technique in real life. No matter what I do to cope I just can’t shake the anxiety away. I know anxiety is a part of life and regardless it’s going to come up but I can’t stop catastrophizing the anxiety I feel. The anxiety makes It hard to focus in school and at work to the point where I’m close to leaving both. How do I get It through my head that I am okay. That anxiety is okay. That any tiny thing my body feels doesn’t mean I’m dying. How can I trust my body. How can I trust myself. How can I trust in the universe. How can I stop.,Why is It hard to accept its just anxiety after numerous tests and reassurance.,4

Anyways today I went a bit mute, I can’t find the energy to talk and it’s hard to communicate how I’m feeling. So today in lab, my friend was getting frustrated because she was hungry from not eating all day. And when lab was over, I kind of rushed out because I felt a panic attack going on. I went to the bathroom to put cold water on my face. She got angry at me, texting me saying “where the fuck are you?” And when she found me she sat there with a look on her face. I told her she can go to the dining hall but instead she went back to the lab classroom and started to talk shit about me to our lab partner.

Ever since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled, but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas- I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days- because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me, thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right now,

And I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety, but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.

372,"35 F and I need help. Apologies for typos (on mobile) and length, but so, so grateful for those who read this. 

My shoulders, chest,  back and jaw are always cleanched like I'm subconsciously trying to curl up into myself. I cant sleep, small sounds cause my heart to race and I wake up with adrenaline. I'm always exhausted, and because of this, I'm feeling so hopeless. I cry out of fear or frustration  at least once a day now making me feel pathetic and empty. I shake, have numb limbs, depersonalization and chronically check my pulse. I feel like I'm dying all the time and like someone vacuumed all the joy and confidence I once built up out of my soul.

I stopped taking sertraline after 8ish years and it's going terribly. I slowly weaned myself off because of an imminent lack of insurance back in September, and I'm not doing well. Before I went off medication,  I went part time from working a full time management position for over 12 years. At first, I was elated to be home so much. I had dreamed of being part time, accomplishing so many things at home, ( we bought a foreclosed home 9 years ago with TONS  of issues) just being less stressed in general, but because of the part time status, I lost insurance. My partner who works 12 hour days and I were not married yet, and knowing I would lose coverage and wanting to get pregnant soon, I slowly weaned myself off Sertraline as responsibly as possible. This actually went okay, surprisingly, but I'm thinking it was because I still had medication in my system. 

Before I was off meds I was binge drinking about 2-3 times per week, which has been an issue since I was 18, as well as insane amounts of weed smoking- so, additional self medication that was frankly really bad to do on meds. Drinking was ingrained in me as a coping mechanism that caused so, so many problems over the years. Being medicated helped numb the terrible anxiety and withdrawing I would go through with drinking, so it made it possible to continue this cycle for years. I am a very naturally anxious person,  from childhood until now. I am an only child who had an extremely verbally abusive father which I know caused a lot of problems. 

By December of this year I had noticed the familiar feelings of not just hints-of-anxiousness, but the crippling anxiety coming back. I drink a bit in Decemeber, and for at least five days after, would notice terrible, horrible anxiety, withdrawals and sleeplessness. This was so much more severe unmedicated I literally had to stop which had not happened consistently since my teens. Because of it being a coping mechanism, and major ingrained habit, I had some huge issues mourning a ""friend"" and psuedo-tool I had used for years to overcome social anxiety and insecurity. This was obviously never helping, but in the throes of addiction and habit, I couldn't recognize it. 
 
Then caffeine started affecting me in a negative way. Even small amounts would cause heart palpitations and severe unease. It became a gateway for a panic attack. I would usually consume a decent amount of caffeine before work, which made me feel more efficient, confident and social. Just like drinking. Now, I had lost two major things I used to cope with life. I had some peace with knowing I should have quit drinking years ago and letting it go, but now I couldn't even handle caffeine? But wait! There's more! Enter weed smoking, which I had already largely cut back. I went from smoking as soon as I got home from  work to just before bed to sleep. I have always had major sleeping issues and maijuana helped turn my obsessive thoughts off so I could sleep. Now it was causing the same panic caffeine did. I had a violent panic attack in January after smoking and almost thought I needed to call an ambulance. 

I'm sure by now, you can see I have some substance reliance issues. I know this, and I'm not proud. I should in theory be proud I stopped three bad habits/addictions AND antidepressants. Instead, I feel lost. I feel empty. I feel devastatingly hopeless. I feel truly alien, like I cant be a normal functioning human. I'm chronically jittery, exhausted and scared. I feel like although overcoming addiction I have backslid into my lowest low. I have had to leave work because of panic attacks. I dont go out to social events unless absolutely necessary, and spend the whole time in partial terror. I have no joy in anything I used to care about. I feel like I'm driving my mother and husband insane with my repetitive, obsessive anxieties, insecurities and attacks. They are so supportive, but I cant help but feel like they are a little over it. 

The last two months have been awful. By now, I expected some relief from my brain getting used to being off meds, but instead I'm now worried this is just who I am unmedicated. I obsess about the house not being fixed, people judging it,  things imminently breaking, about not being pregnant yet, ( biological clock shit) disapointing family and friends and its leaving me feeling utterly hopeless. I have been in therepy off and on for years, read countless books, every supplement out there, meditation, watched tons of videos and documentaries on anxiety, improved my diet, reached out to others, breathing exercises... you name it. I know most of the tools to help with anxiety. I've tried almost all of them.  I have held off on going back on medication in hopes of becoming pregnant, but that hasn't happened yet and frankly I dont want to start and stop medication again right now. 

I'm afraid of everything. I feel like I'm disconnected and disassociated from myself. Its unrelenting. I dont have ""good"" days, lately. Shit, I'd take mediocre ones! I have tried to push through, get tasks done around the house to feel like I'm accomplishing something, positive affirmations...nothing is working. I'm so tired. I'm so sick of being afraid of basic life tasks, like making appointments, working, social obligations, etc. I'm tired of feeling adrenaline over every sound, waking up anxious, taking hours to fall asleep because I'm anxious and dont sleep. Im so sore because I'm always clenched and tense. I'm always checking my pulse. Im always worried about horrible things happening to myself and family, health related or otherwise. This cyclical unrelenting chronic crippling anxiety is making me insane. I am considering therepy again, but past experiences have not been the best. 

I guess I'm just trying to find someone who gets it. This isn't something I feel like the average person who I've talked to about anxiety understands. Who else has panic attacks in the freezer aisle of the grocery store, work or at baby showers? My senses feel so heightened to any stimuli. I cant keep putting on a brave face and hearing people's surprise when I tell them how anxious I am all the time. ""But you're so calm! You seem so chill!"" Ugh. I must mask it well because I'm internally combusting. This doesnt feel like it will ever relent, and I'm starting to just feel anxious and depressed, chronically. I cant live like this anymore, and I'm losing all hope of improving.

I don't really know where to start I've been struggling for such a long time and I just don't know what's an anxiety symptom, or symptom of an underlying medical condition anymore. I've had anxiety and OCD for the longest time, had CBT a couple of times in my life but I still suffer immensely with anxiety, it has taken the form of different themes over the years but at the moment I'm struggling awful with health anxiety. 

I have lots of physical symptoms, and I do have some medical issues too, and I'm finding it really hard to differentiate between the two.

My main physical symptoms are:
-tight chest and breathlessness (to the point it feels like my airways are closing up)
-strange sensation in throat and tongue
-scratchy throat
-diarrhea (sometimes severe) &amp; constipation
-abdominal pain &amp; nausea
-brain fog and intense headaches
-light headedness
-dry throat
-nasal drip
- feeling of tight muscles and tension in my abdomen, neck and shoulders
-some tingling and numbness in various areas of body

Aside from this I have been diagnosed with polyps on the gallbladder, a liver cyst and mild fatty liver recently. I have also found some small hard lumps in centre of chest/ left of abdomen just along the bottom rib. I am getting these checked but not until 17th April! 
I have really been struggling to eat recently, every time I do eat I get a lot of the physical symptoms I've described above, then I get frightened I'm having an allergic reaction and am going to develop anaphylaxis (I've never been allergic to food before, but I do have asthma) so I just avoid eating. I've lost over 2 stone in weight in the past 6 weeks. 

When I got the diagnosis of gallbladder polyps and liver cyst/ fatty liver it really set me back and panicked me. I've had two family members die of liver cirrhosis (they were alcoholics though, and I don't drink anymore, and have never to that extent) and I think I just got it into my head that I was going to die or these growths were going to develop in to cancer. 

I can't stop googling and searching my symptoms and I've come across something called MCAS, and with the physical symptoms of allergy and various growths I have in mind, I've convinced myself that I have MCAS.

I really don't know what to do to be honest, I've got a young family that I need to care for but instead I'm bed ridden and feeling like rubbish all the time and it's really getting me down.","I don't know whether it's anxiety or an underlying health condition, at my wits end 😔",4

385,"I’ve been thinking a lot about AI recently. The explosion of Chat-GPT, Midjourney, DALLE-2….someone with zero writing or art skills can spend 3 seconds coming up with a prompt and generate something incredible. Something a human would spend hours or even days coming up with. And it’s accelerating faster than we could have imagined. AI voice spoofing, AI generated images of celebrities and politicians, plagiarized college essays…these things were unimaginable 6 months ago. 

All this gives me anxiety and not just because I’m a writer as my profession. It’s devaluing human talent and creativity - everyone can now do it, therefore it means nothing. Over-saturation renders everything meaningless. And the irony is that humans made this tech that is now outshining all of us…and will ultimately do everything better than we can.

This is a pivotal time in humanity and I am not ready for it and I don’t think anyone is really ready for it. Everything from the way we work to the way we consume media will be completely upended by AI.

388,"Hello! 

I have always been anxious, and as of 2-3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I've been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications (Lexapro, Zoloft, medical marijuana, CBD, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax, Amitriptyline), and the only thing that worked were the benzos. I'm extremely lucky to have an NP who fills my Xanax refills. The problem is... I don't want to be addicted to this medication. I take it very sparingly, which is why it works so well, but I only take these when I feel nauseous/jittery/panicky, which, fortunately, is not 24/7. However, I do have GAD pretty bad. In the shower, thoughts just race and I can't find the ""off"" switch. It's ruined my sleep. It's taken a dump on my memory. I just cannot live like this anymore. 

Meditations help in the moment I do them, but I feel like I need to be medicated. I was on Zoloft for about 6 months, and it helped tremendously, but when I tried getting back on it (I properly titrated my dose when I get off them), for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable. Granted, I started back at 50mg, when before I was on it for 25mg for a week and then 50mg the second week and continued for 4-6 weeks. It could also be that at the time I could tolerate medical marijuana, but now, that makes me either anxious/jittery or straight-up nauseous. 

Lexapro? Forget it. I started at 10mg, and that was a nightmare. I was so nauseous by day 2, if it wasn't for my anti-nausea med, I would've projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor. The other time I was at 5mg, and I felt so cracked out. 

I also don't like that SSRIs are rough on my body for 4-6 weeks. Maybe that's just the gamble you take, but I hate having increased anxiety, inability to ejaculate, and horrendous stomach pains for a month. Does that sound like fun to anyone? 

I took amitriptyline, and that was more for chronic pain, and it barely did anything, and as for anxiety, I didn't notice much of a difference either, and I tried this medication at 10 and 25mg.

I have an appointment with my NP tomorrow, and she is well aware I struggle with anxiety. Is there a medication that's not an antidepressant that works for GAD and is not a benzo, meaning I can take as often as needed? 

I've also tried supplements like L-Theanine, Melatonin, and Ashwagandha, and they don't do crap. 

Any experiences with non-antidepressants that worked for you?",Anxiety med. that's not an antidepressant?,4
389,"Whenever i have any “event” i get insane rising anxiety leading to it. Anything like public presentation, job interview, doctor appt, or even going to a friends house party or “going out” (haha i rarely)

Days before ill start preparing , night before i can barely sleep. I can feel adrenaline increasing 24-48 hours. I get EXTREMELY alert.

The day of i wake up i cant eat anything. Cant even drink more than a few sips of water.

The hours leading up i begin HARD coughing and dry heaving. To the point ill damage my throat and it gets sore. I never actually throw up but this has been happening so long i just dont eat to be safe. Still i get uncontrollable gagging. Like i actually think i gave myself a hernia. Im talking violent gagging until i see stars, floaters and lights in my eyes, heart racing, chest muscles / stomach strained and hurting from the none stop gagging and heaving and coughing.

Then right when i walk into the “event” its all gone. 

Im still nervous but my mind tends to blank out and i disassociate a lot. This really fucks up technical job interviews because i totally blank out. A pure calm bliss blank state.

AFTER, i go home a complete weight is lifted off me. Im STARVING now. Extremely low anxiety, relaxed, rest state. Eating a ton because i probably have been eating 500-1000cals the last few days.

392,"This past few months I’ve had a set of symptoms that have had me worried that I have a neurological disorder. I am wondering if these symptoms could be caused by stress, and if anyone here has had similar symptoms they know to be caused by stress.

A little context, I recently got accepted into my dream job. The only hitch is that it has intense training for six months, where if you fail a test at any point you are dismissed. The material we are required to study is immense in volume and the tests are close to twice a week.

In the month leading up to the course I found myself experiencing a small head fog. It developed more and more over the weeks into the worst head fog of my life. I could barely think and always felt a sort of pressure in my head. Math I would normally fly through was difficult and even just simple thoughts were hard to get out sometimes. As the course started my vision started to feel off, not quite sure if it was/is double or blurry as it’s not that bad, but I can tell it’s off. My eyes also got super sore for a week or so. About a week ago I also started to feel my left jaw and arm go a bit numb/tingly. It’s mostly there but comes and goes in intensity. 

Since the head fog I have been chronically online in search of answers which has lead me down every rabbit hole. I am frightened i have something like MS, and though I know my research into it along with my stress with my course is more likely to blame, I can’t help but doubt that stress alone could give me blurry vision, numb arm/face, and immense brain fog

I would really appreciate anyone’s experience with stress, ms, or related symptoms.

It's triggered very easily by the confrontational tone my mom takes sometimes, it's lately about a sensitive topic. She assumes my feelings and it feels like she's arguing with me about things where there's no need to argue, because im literally just telling her how im feeling bad about the things i did wrong in my relationship and such, and she's arguing about why i keep feeling this way about it and keep blaming myself for a lot of it. She says things about my ex that i don't know how to feel about. Things like ""her life is negative and all over the place anyway and she dragged you into it"" and all that. 

I feel like when she argues with me about my feelings it's a form of gaslighting. 

I had been doing progress recovering from hating myself and seeing things more objectively concerning the relationship. 

I always feel like im pretending whenever im not doing well or when i intentionally try to get better. I never perceived i had real struggles in life. In therapy, i saw that i did have things to deal with invisibly with my family. I had set, for the last few days, on the road for feeling more authentic with myself and people around me. I felt the breakup was an obvious hurdle that i can make use of for growth without feeling pretentious about overcoming things, because of how it forced me to rethink things about myself while validating why they're there to begin with.

Mom's argument for the relationship is just that my ex was a very negative person who's carelessly trying to gatekeep me. I spiralled so hard after a tough breakup conversation where i saw it wasnt true. I hated how i couldve been convinced of that too. I hate the person it made me. I hate how in my head i was throughoit the whole relationship, and mom contributed to that. Im too impressionable with mom.

Somehow, these things are linked now that i write without inhibitions. I guess i'll just keep writing until this feeling of emptiness passes.

I don’t find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends, doing the things I love or anything fun. My biggest problem and the main reason I’m making this post is that I don’t talk to ANYONE about it. I absolutely hate having to talk about how I feel and what I’m thinking, even if it’s not about anxiety.  All of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only. I actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit. I’m just tired of feeling numb, I’m tired of not having fun, I’m tired of this emptiness and I’m tired of feeling and thinking so many things I don’t understand. But this has been my entire life. It’s not an on and off thing. It’s how I think and how I feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life. Im scared that no amount of work, or therapy will fix it because I feel like I basically have to rewire my entire brain and lifestyle.",Severe anxiety,4

422,"So I’m not too sure if this is the correct place to post this or get advice, but I’d just like to hear what people have to say about it. 

I’ve been working at my engineering job for 4 years now. It’s a decent job with VERY good pay and decent hours that work for me. But for the same amount of time it has been the main source of my anxiety. It’s quite a tricky job with a lot of learning involved, and it’s taken me a long time to get to grips with. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in the process and with some parts of the job I still feel anxious about what I’ll have to do or about making mistakes while doing those things. 

The main thing however is the environment, and one particular person in it. We’ll call him Bob (say hello Bob). He used to be my team leader, but stepped back from that role to become team engineer (still a somewhat ranked role in itself but more technical) and is one of the most experienced and gifted guys at the place, having been there for decades at this point. Let me preface by saying a good chunk of the time this guy is ok. 

However, Bob is VERY hotheaded and temperamental, and can be passive aggressive, will openly berate people for innocent mistakes and will make “jokes” about co-workers and their abilities/performance that often seem to have a hint too much opinion behind them (often to the point where you’re not sure when he’s joking and when he isn’t). He takes his job very very seriously, often to the point of some sort of corporate Stockholm syndrome devotion (that may be an exaggeration but you get what I mean). As an example, he’s gone off on one at me before for not working much overtime and he has commitment and that’s why he does loads (implying I don’t pull my weight by not working weekends etc).

His whole demeanour makes me extremely uncomfortable and feel intimidated, because I don’t know when he’s gonna be in one of his bad moods or take issue with something. It’s been joked about before whether we’re gonna get Jekyll or Hyde today. 

About 2 months ago he openly berated (near shouting) in front of the whole team and my manager for misplacing a tool during an audit (which I understand is a bit negligent, but I did find it quickly afterwards), it was embarrassing and made me feel small, especially since that could’ve been handled in a far more professional manner. The other day, he made a comment about my rate of work, rhetorically asking “jokingly” why I can only do 1 of something while he can do a lot more in the same amount of time. Funnily enough he’s done that multiple times in the past and it never fails to make me feel heightened and worthless. I get that I’m a slow worker and not the most skilled, but he makes it out as if I’m lazy and not bothered about my job… I am very much the opposite. I just have less experience and work at a slower pace than most because I worry so much about getting things wrong.

I just don’t find Bob very approachable and that makes it even more difficult because he’s our team engineer, which means sometimes I have to ask him questions. But it’s been very often that he’s responded to questions as if they’re stupid or something I should’ve known already.

What doesn’t help is that for the longest time the team has enabled his behaviour, saying to me “don’t take it personally, it’s just the way he is”. Even recently when another team member was talking to me like crap and I spoke to my manager about it after finally having enough, I mentioned Bob and while he spoke to the other person and she hasn’t bothered me since, he said he wasn’t gonna talk to Bob at this time because it “requires a far more delicate approach”. From what I understand Bob has his own issues, one of them being bad anxiety but it seems like he’s dealing with it in very unhealthy ways.

At this point, I’m just not sure what to do. I don’t feel like I can ask my manager to do something about it because of his Bob might react or what he might do. It’s not like the company would do anything anyway because he’s so good at his job and does a hell of a lot. I could move teams, where the work would be more challenging so I could be Maliki life harder for myself. But if I stay I have to stay in an environment that makes me constantly anxious and seriously affects my mental health, to the point where just leaving my job has crossed my mind in moments of madness.

Any advice or ways to maybe cope with this would be really welcomed.

424,"Hi everyone, I wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience (even with medication).

Ever since 2020, I developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel. It started with little things; I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. 

Eventually, it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block, usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps, which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me, quite literally, to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.

After beginning medication, this generally subsided to a manageable level, and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then, in December of 2022, my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us, travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured, but I’ve been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. 

This hyper-vigilance (I drive quite a bit) has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress, I’ve ground my molars to completely flat, and the tension within my body from being so, braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving, is really locking me up. I’ve gained a lot of weight, too. It’s lead to serious depression as I’ve built a life that requires me to have a limber body.

Does anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement… I’m really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.

426,"I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me, and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions (like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way) has been the most life changing thing I've learned. I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people, but [here is a link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577d2ce937c58194f7d39816/t/60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa19/1623714139969/dbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf) to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods, and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym - cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face, intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute, paced breathing or breath work (sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can), all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all &lt;3",For anyone struggling with fairly severe anxiety episodes - I highly recommend DBT distress tolerance skills.,4

436,"I'm 23 and my anxiety started with health anxiety, and once I learnt how to deal with that it seems to have transformed into intrusive thoughts about past mistakes and how they could affect me now.

I know that regretting it means I have grown and am not that person anymore, but I still feel so guilty and feel like I don't deserve to forgive myself or move on.

It first started when my dog started to act not normal. Her head would keep tilting every which way like she was drunk and eventually kept looking at the ceiling. It got so bad to the point where she couldn’t walk or wouldn’t eat anymore. It got worse during the weekend and we don’t have an emergency vet near us so we had to call an on call vet from our clinic to come and look at her. He didn’t really say much about her, just figured that it was neurological. My mom planned to bring her back to her regular vet on Monday so they could further help her. She kept having seizures throughout the day as well and had labored breathing. My mom laid with her on the couch at night and watched the clock, waiting for 7 am to arrive. My dog didn’t make it through the night. She died at 3 in the morning. 

I woke up that morning to my mom and dad telling me that she passed away. I got up out of my bed and quickly walked to the living room because I wanted to be with her. She died laying in her little bed that she loved. My family came and sat around her, crying and telling her that we love her. I didn’t want it to be real. I wanted to say, “Mom, dad, she’s just sleeping she’ll wake up and start barking any minute.” But reality came back and that’s when I knew, this is really happening. 

I went to school the next day. I didn’t want to. I just wanted to stay in my bed all day and sleep. I was so tired. I couldn’t even pay attention to what the professor was saying because I felt numb and detached from reality. After I got out of class I started feeling like I couldn’t breathe. It hit me like a ton of bricks. My chest hurt bad too. I started to take my anxiety pills again after that. 

I never had anxiety this bad before. I realized it’s not like a cold that you can shake off. It sticks with you everywhere you go for a long time. I started off getting shortness of breath and chest pain. Then it turned into feeling like my skin and heart were on fire and panic attacks that would jolt me awake at night and keep me up until 6 am. It did get better with time once I learned how to manage it. 

A few weeks later I was sending out reminders to my bridesmaids that dress shopping was coming up. I had reminded them months before because I wanted to make sure everyone could be there. I hadn’t heard from one of my bridesmaids in about a month so I reached out to her to see if she was doing ok. She hadn’t given me a response. The next day I asked if she was still coming, no response. On Saturday, we arrived to the boutique to pick out bridesmaid dresses. She didn’t text or call and didn’t show either. She finally texted me the day after telling me she was backing out of being a bridesmaid. I was fine with that but wish she had communicated with me better. 

A few days after that I found a couple of black scuff marks on my car. There’s a little crack by the marks to. Turns out somebody side swiped my car and I didn’t even see it until now. I figured I probably got hit in the college parking lot while I was in class so I called college security and had to meet up with an officer to give them specific time frames to look at in their security camera footage.

**Feb 2020:** I check in about how she's doing, if she still wants to do dinner, and we schedule a dinner. Our mutual friend happens to be in town so it ends up the three of us at dinner together.

**July 2020**: Pandemic is happening. She includes me on an email invite to her bday party at her house. I don't feel comfortable going so decline.

**June 2021**: I am feeling lonely and reach out to find out how she's doing and if she'd like to go to this outdoor concert with me. She ends up not being able to make it that day, but says we should one day meet up for dinner and I agree. I remind her we had talked about some greek place that time we went out and she says ""yeah, let's do dinner soon.""

**September 2021**: Never heard from her about dinner and reach out again. She says her next two months of weekends are booked with fall activities with friends. She mentions a few she's doing that I could join. I tell her I'd be interested in this farm visit she's doing. She tells me it'll probably be some weekend in Oct, but she'll let me know the details once it gets closer and she and her friends decide the exact day.  I never hear anything.

**March 2023 (Now):** Get a random text from her asking how I'm doing. I get excited thinking she's interested in reconnecting. I'm feeling extra depressed and lonely and friendless as more friends have moved away/lost touch. She asks if I still live where I used to and if I still work remote. Yes and yes. I ask how she's doing, but she's vague only telling me she saw another friend of our mutual friend recently and that she still lives in the same town. Then, she says the reason she is reaching out to me is because she has a friend who is single and she thought of me. She sends me all his details and asks if I was interested.

Man, did I get so depressed! I thought she had been interested in reconnecting because she was interested in a friendship with me and regrets we never ended up hanging out again. I kept expecting her to suggest we meet up or something, but it turns out she is only interested in me for a potential date for her friend. I feel hurt that here's someone I wanted to be friends with who I (for the hundredth time) thought might want to be friends with me and I again feel rejected.

I know I could ONCE AGAIN ask if this woman wants to grab dinner (for the 1000th time), but I feel ridiculous at this point and like a loser. She clearly is not interested in hanging out with me or I wouldn't have had to be the one to reach out to her every time AND she would have followed up on those details about the farm visit back in 2021 that she did go on.

What do you all make of all of this?

tl;dr: Heard from someone who I had been previously trying to befriend for the first time in nearly 2 years. Thought she was interested in the friendship, but really reached for another reason. Made multiple attempts in the past to hang out with no result and feel like a loser trying again.

458,"So, I've reached the point when I amassed enough courage to ask for an appointment with a psychiatrist. I've done therapy for about 5 years and never was brave enough to ask my therapist if I had either anxiety or depression. But 5 months ago I started with chronic tensional headaches - finished college and found two jobs, ended up very stressed, which I controlled after a neurologist prescribed me pregabalin. However, I've been struggling with other somatic symptoms that lead me to say, okay you waited too much, it's time to do it. Even though I hate the idea of being that self-diagnose person, I've been doing a lot of reflection and truly believe I have several symptoms of anxiety, perhaps social or general anxiety.

I will be seeing this doc (who was very recommended to me), and I fear judgment but much much more fear is if I get prescribed meds that mess me up worse. I know she's an outstanding professional, she has appropiately medicated my bf's niece for anxiety, and honestly doubt I'd need something ""strong"" but I'm so scared of start taking meds, I fear there's no turning back from it. I fear it changes me so badly that I have bad moments at my job in front of everyone, like crying or a panic attack, or that I make an embarrassment. I don't want to lose my job since it (there are two but the full time one) has helped me to get out of my lifeless and procrastination days. 

Haven't seen my therapist lately since she had a temporary license and now I'm also unsure if I should come back because she never made me a diagnosis. My general doctor told me to come back to therapy asap. 

Sorry for the long post - I'd like to know if someone relates to this or your experiences, but mostly if you know about meds and if I'm just panicking too much or maybe I just need to know this before meeting the psychiatrist.",I'm hesitant to get a diagnosis,4

i've beeb freaking out ever since then that she was throwing a hint that i don't stink but i have asked two people i trust that same day if i stink and they said no but what she said was too odd and random for it to not be a hint although she did ask me for a hug before leaving after the whole thing happened so maybe it wasn't about me?

460,"Hi everyone, I was posting to see if anyone else suffered from anxiety and has heart issues going on as well. I have severe anxiety and I’m definitely a hypochondriac so I started taking Zoloft 3 months ago to help. However, for 2 years I have dealt with heart problems. My heart rate gets super high to the 170s at rest, I get dizzy, chest pain, and I have a low-ish blood pressure on top of that. I also noticed a couple months ago this feeling I get where I feel like my heart skips a beat and my breath gets taken away which I discovered was me having PVCs. I have done numerous EKGs which have been abnormal but my one cardiologist told me I’m a 26 year old otherwise healthy person so it’s fine. I did an echo and stress test 2 days ago so I’m awaiting those results. One of my previous cardiologists told me he believes this all stems from stress and anxiety and once I manage that it will go away, which I agree with to an extent. I had another cardiologist tell me that even if I’m stressed out having a heart rate sustain in the 170s is abnormal. I am also a nurse so I can’t tell if me having an understanding of medical stuff makes it more difficult for me to handle because I’m constantly thinking worst case scenario. I have this overwhelming fear that I’m going to be one of those people in their 20s that has a heart attack or other complication.

The previous person in the position had left already and I was trained by someone filling in for the moment. The training I got doesn’t even scratch the surface of all that I have to do. There’s so many things don’t know how to do or didn’t know I was supposed to do. I’ve read through my manual for help and there’s not enough information.

so one of my anxiety symptoms that sometimes happens is that large parts of my body just go completely numb, mostly my arms, legs, chest, neck and face.

Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

470,"I hate driving to new places, and this has helped me tons:

1. Pre-research the address: if the time is flexible, what times are the least busy (google maps is a good one to check). Is the destination open (check the website ahead of time).
2. Use Street View to check out the entire route.
3. Get your nav app all ready. I’ve found that Apple Maps (if you have this) is amazing because it will say things like don’t make right after this stoplight. Make a right at the next one. The destination is in the right, pull into the next driveway on your left, etc.
4. Leave with plenty of time to spare. Assume you will make a few wrong turns. Give yourself extra time to lose your way.
5. Research parking ahead of time. Use apps like Parking Hero. Use the city’s websites to find out the capacity of municipal parking ramps, if available. Scope out street parking with Google Street View, too.
6. Find alternatives to parallel parking. You can also park near driveways, so you can’t get parked in (easy pull in/out).
7. Dress comfortably so that if you get stressed, you won’t get super sweaty.
8. Make sure you have enough gas
9. Adjust your mirrors, clean windows, headlights for visibility, ahead of time

471,"Hello everyone I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male. 5""9 155lbs. I don't smoke, i don't drink alcohol nor use any drugs. 

So it's been almost 1.5 years that I've developed some strange symptoms, that have really deteriorated my life.

They basically started after i caught covid (i was vaccined prior with the j&amp;j vaccine). Since then, i get heart pains all the time. They happen multiple times a day and usually last a few minutes before they go away. I've been to 2 different cardiologists who ran an EKG and echo and said that everything was fine. I also had a  48 hour Holter monitor that showed some pvc's (200/a day),but docs weren't concerned at all. 

Also after covid my WBC are basically running around the 11-13k range (before that CBC's would come back fine). They were fine before i got infected, but it's been almost 1.5 year that they won't go down. My lymphocytes are also high (45-50) and neutrophils low 35-40). Everything else comes back completely fine. I went to a hematologist and he run some tests for malignancies(leukemia) but they came back negative. 

One of the worst symptoms also is the spasms I've been getting all over my body. They can happen literally anywhere and they always last a few seconds before they go away. I've searched a lot about them and i guess it's most likely BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). But it never stops. I think my nerve system has been permanently damaged. 

Lastly i get random aches in my stomach and usually at the upper left abdominal region. I've had an abdominal echo and it was fine. But i get random shooting pains along with painful gasses. These are the symptoms I've been dealing with the past 1.5 year. They're all so random and I can't connect them somehow. High WBC usually mean infection, so I'm guessing that an autoimmune disease might have been triggered?

I've also found a lump in my arm. It's been there for 1.5 year as well, i showed it to my gp and he said that it's a lipoma, but it's still there. It hasn't grown but it hurts sometimes. Things like sarcoma drive my mind crazy. It feels like my body is constantly trying to kill me. 

The whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and stress. I thought that things would get better with time, but no, nothing has changed and it's been so long. I'm only 20 years old and I'm afraid that I'm gonna drop dead by a heart attack or cancer. I used to be an athlete but i stopped after all these, because i became afraid.

487,"Hello all,

I am 22M and been struggling since December when I had a marijuana induced panic attack. First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since it’s something she enjoys. Like an idiot, I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didn’t sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then I’ve had constant derealization, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness, random headaches that come and go all over my head, body pains, stomach pain, etc..

Since then I’ve had 2 rounds of blood work, CT scan, MRI, seen an ENT, and a neurologist. I’ve also been given all of the following medications and more: prednisone, meclizine, clonidine, zyrtec, flonase, antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so I’d say it’s fair to diagnose as anxiety-related… though my therapist (I’m new to therapy since this all began) says he’s never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. I’ve been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and I’d say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so I’m still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasn’t thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for off-label use to begin with.

Overall I would say I am at about 25-30%. When I started the Zoloft I felt around 0-5% honestly. I was convinced I was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first 2 weeks.

I have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what I’m trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily, get outside, drive to my apartment (1hr), and work remote a few hours a day. I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when I’m busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25% awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing it’s own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but they’re not. It’s like being stuck in a dreaming state and it’s so scary and frustrating. It’s very hard to describe but I don’t have any delusions or hallucinations so I don’t believe I am suffering from a psychotic illness. 

I have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last 3 months have really tested me. Over the last 4 years I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression but I was able to power through 2 degrees, a long distance relationship, a breakup, and building a career I would hardly have dreamed of years ago. I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this, but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything I’d have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that it’s easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time, because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life. I’ve learned lessons in gratitude, kindness, and compassion that I want to share with others.

P.S.
I really look forward to getting back to the things I enjoy once I’m better: bodybuilding, soccer, vinyls, and working!",Relentless Nightmare since December!,4

Sometimes I think the solution is to tell him “hey can you text me back in x amount of time” or “I don’t like how you don’t message me for awhile” sure, short term solution but I know things will come up and he’ll eventually resent me for making him do that, and this goes way beyond him as well.

507,"Hi everyone, 

This is my first time posting on here and this may turn out to be an essay but please bear with me and read to the end. I promise to make this as concise as possible.

I'm in my late 20's (male) and have had anxiety since the beginning of high school. It felt super overwhelming back then and high school could have been an amazing experience had anxiety not gotten in the way. 

I went to university fairly late and after graduating kept landing contract work, and eventually got stuck working at the same grocery store I applied to as an undergrad. The anxiety carried over into the workplace and resulted in my inability to work at a fast pace. I always felt mentally and physically exhausted.

This is where I have to mention alcohol and caffeine, both of which produce superhuman like effects but with a caveat:

I tried alcohol for the first time in Montreal at the age of 18 and after downing 2 beers it felt like I had ingested an elixir. My worries went away instantly, and felt my brain firing on all cylinders. There were 0 negative emotions, and a profound combination of confidence, energy, euphoria, and heightened creativity. I never got addicted to drinking (for obvious reasons), and only drink on occasion, but every time I do, it produces the same effects. I also never get drunk. 

Coffee seems to produce eerily similar effects and I realized this a few years ago after I had a coffee at work and felt like I had snorted crack. I thought I could take on the world, and was super excited that I had finally found a solution to my problem. Unfortunately however, if I have coffee everyday for 4 days straight, by the 4th day it produces the exact opposite effects and I'm left feeling sleepy and lethargic. For me to feel the full effects of coffee, I need to refrain from it for at least 7 days. 

Fast forward to today where I recently started working construction as a sprinkler fitter/pipefitter and  absolutely hate it. Apart from being a fast-paced environment, I'm asthmatic with an allergy to dust and constantly drilling holes into a concrete ceiling has made my asthma worse, plus the cement we use to glue the plastic leaves me with a pounding headache during and after work, so I know my days are numbered. The company that I'm employed with is currently waiting on a new project so I've had the last 7 days off 

During this time I've begun doing research on career alternatives and have become very interested in the online world and have decided to upgrade my skills in e-commerce, digital marketing, and video editing (among other things). 

My morning routine involves getting up at 8 o'clock (feeling tired), having breakfast, followed by tea with milk (which produces similar effects to coffee with much less intensity). After having tea, my anxiety goes away and I become very focused; however, when the caffeine wears off, my anxiety returns and I go back to feeling mentally exhausted (constant worrying, overthinking, fear of failure, lack of motivation etc.)

As far as I know, I'm not depressed, nor do I have low self-esteem. I feel good about the way I look and the shape I'm in. Going to the gym helps. 

I don't have any bad habits. I don't smoke, nor do I indulge in social media looking for a dopamine fix. Most of my free time is spent reading online and on YouTube searching educational videos.  I also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night but usually wake up tired. The only complaint I have with life is my anxiety. Without it I have a powerful personality and I feel like I'm capable of achieving so much but it's causing me to operate at only 50% of my full potential.

I was wondering if anyone is able to offer any insight as to why alcohol and caffeine produce such similar effects, practically eliminating my anxiety before the effects wear off, and if anyone has had similar experiences? Could alcohol and caffeine contain something which I might be deficient in? Could I get this in a pill form?

I was thinking of making an appointment with my family doctor but just thought I'd reach out here to see what the members here have to add. 

I'm open to the idea of trying antidepressants but at the same time worried about the side effects. Do antidepressants really only cause side effects in the first couple of weeks?  Based on some of my research, that seems to be the case. 

Apologies for the long post and I would greatly appreciate any input.

One day, a young girl named Mia came to the village, seeking relief from her overwhelming anxiety. Upon hearing about Elara's wisdom, she ventured to the peaceful grove where the elephant resided. The moment Mia approached, she felt her heart rate slowing and her breath deepening.

""Elara, I've heard of your wisdom and calming presence. Please, can you help me with my anxiety?"" Mia asked timidly.

Elara looked at her with gentle eyes and replied, ""Of course, dear child. Sit down beside me, and let me share with you the secret to finding peace within yourself.""

As Mia settled down, Elara began to tell her a story.

""Long ago, our village was visited by a wise old monk. He too had experienced the tranquility of our valley and wished to uncover the source of this peaceful energy. He spent many days meditating under the ancient oak tree at the center of the village. Finally, he discovered the secret: within each of us exists a tiny, peaceful oasis, an inner sanctuary that remains untouched by the chaos of the world.""

The wise elephant continued, ""To access this sanctuary, you must learn to quiet your mind and listen to the rhythm of your own breath. Begin by taking slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each breath, imagine your worries dissolving into the wind, leaving only peace and tranquility behind.""

Mia closed her eyes and followed Elara's guidance. As she inhaled and exhaled, she felt her anxiety ebbing away, replaced with a sense of calm and safety she had never known before.

After some time, Mia opened her eyes and looked at the wise elephant. ""Thank you, Elara. Your words have brought me peace, and I will carry this lesson with me wherever I go.""

As Mia prepared to leave, Elara touched her trunk gently to the girl's shoulder. ""Remember, dear child, your inner sanctuary is always within you. Whenever you feel overwhelmed or anxious, simply close your eyes, breathe deeply, and allow yourself to find refuge in the peaceful oasis of your heart.""

With newfound strength and a heart filled with gratitude, Mia returned to her life, carrying the wisdom of Elara and the tranquility of the village with her. She had discovered the power of her inner sanctuary, and now, she was ready to face the world with courage and serenity.",Inner Sanctuary of Peace,4
523,"tw: self-harm, bad thoughts? I'm not really sure what else, sorry

So uh, I've been feeling down and really anxious for thr past few weeks. It's probably silly, but I cut myself a while ago snd I hadn't done that for a while so I think it's really getting a low point. And it's probably just because of my poor emotional regulation stuff, but I kinda need to get this out because I don't have anyone else to talk to about this.

To start with, my academic workload's increased these past few weeks. I'm doing a research paper with a group, but it's just stressing me out. I'm um overthinking about how it would fail? Or if I'm not a good leader and I'm affecting my classmates' grades because of it. It's just, well, the thought of it is always there, and I can't really get rid of it because it's not yet done. 

Then there's this family tree project that we have, and I'm using my mom's family with it— I'm not really close with my dad's side of the family, so I can't exactly switch to his family. Uh the problem is, my mom has problems with her family, and I don't want to bring it up so I keep putting it off. I don't want to make her upset, and the thought of doing so is just making me anxious.

There's also the little things. Exams, quizzes, presentations, etc. I failed a quiz for the first time in a few years and my teacher got upset about it so I'm kinda panicking and trying to review more haha

Then well my birthday's coming up. We had this whole catering thing going on, but there's been problems with the payment and stuff. Mom made a mistake because she was outside when the manager asked for the payment, and she got really stressed because she couldn't get her money back. The manager hasn't exactly been cooperative, and they've been insistent on the payment, so yeah. Mom got angry and kinda blamed me cause I was the one who liked the idea of the catering thing. I promised her that I would take care of it since it was mostly my fault since she didn't like it but I pushed, so I've been in contact with the manager and everything but the situation's still messy. It's just more stress? More anxiety. Hooray, I guess.

We're still not done with the preparations and stuff and I really want to help but I've been busy with school, and when I get home there's no time to go outside and get what's needed. It's stressing Mom out, and I think that's part of the reason why she got angry, so I wanted to get this done. But I can't, and I have to wait for the weekends to actually be able to do stuff.

There's also the scholarship tests, although I've already taken them. It's just making me nervous, because if I didn't pass then it would be difficult to go to college becaude my family isn't really financially stable. It's just pressuring me? I think? I'm having trouble identifying how I feel without wanting to break down lol

It's also hard to fall asleep. I feel like the only rest I get is the minutes before I fall asleep, so I try to prolong it as long as possible. I think I'm afraid of waking up tomorrow because it just means that nothing's resolved yet and I just. Yeah.

Uh, that's it I guess. Sorry if this is all negative. If you have some advice (especially about the sleeping thing), it's all welcome! Thanks.",Advice?,4
524,"I am so exhausted and just need to know that I am not alone. 

I have been struggling with health anxiety since October of 2022. It started off with the fear of seizures (no family history, no increased risk) and now it’s onto heart attacks and cardiac arrests. I’ve had 2 EKGs, a 48-hour holter monitor, and an echocardiogram. All came back normal. My cholesterol is fine, blood pressure is fine. 

I don’t know how to get over this irrational fear of uncertainty and unknown. I feel the constant need for control and I don’t know how to stop.

526,"So before i start, let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had, i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.

My mom was medicated for it briefly, my dad is medicated for it and also has PTSD, and it runs in both sides of the family. I figured it out in my early 20's and I have been seeing all these  things about myself in a new light ever since. Currently suspicious that I might have ocd.

Something I am frustrated with is that I had a lot of signs and symptoms, but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time. In highschool I had one friend, and she was always telling me I was a worrywart, and openly mocked me about things I did. (For example, I could never just cross a street. Had to be with the walk signal, and then I would RUN across it, and one day she made a big deal about it to my face)

Nobody ever asked WHY. Why I had almost no friends, why I didn't learn to drive until I was almost 30, why I am always going around giving people warnings about their safety. One time I had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced, which was very rare for me. And my mom said ""she's just being dramatic and wants attention"" and that was the end of that. I was also ""the responsible one"". They just don't have time for my feelings.

I try to talk to my dad, who seems like the person who would understand the most, and I'll say ""I have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious"" and he will go ""SPEAKING OF ANXIETY AND DRIVING, YOUR SISTER HAS COME ALONG SO FAR IN HER DRIVING!"" Or I will try to tell him I think I might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what I'm saying to him.

Since mid january almost to today, I'm been having everything, chest pains, chills, heartburn and I feel the pain in the chest, arms, neck and sometime in the teeth because of clenching my jaw, also burping and yawning like crazy.

I've done 3 electrocardiograms in lest than a month and everything came out ok, no hypertrophy, not ischemia, nothing, a healthy heart.

I've been into ER three times, the second the most severe I had everything, chest pain, brain zap, stomach felt like it collapse and when I got connected into a machine and they told me that I had nothing, I was fine, my lungs where ok and my heart was ok, when they told me that, all the feelings went dissapearing slowly to feel normal again. And this happend the the third time, when I got severe chest pain, the ambulance came to My house and the paramedics connected me into an electrocardiogram machine and told me that I was ok, My heart was ok only that I need to check my pressure because was a bit high and as I was ok they didn't take me to a hospital, I went to ER anyways to check my pressure and again I was ok a bit high but nothing to hospitalize me.

In the end I've been with múltiple doctors even a friend that is also a doctor and they told me the same, I'm at zero risk from a heart attack right now, I'm physically healthy, my collesterol levels are ok, a bit high in the ldl side, but everyone told me that is nothing to worry about.
And in the last electro with the chest pain, something should have come out if it was really the heart and that I wouldn't be able to talk or walk as I was everytime. My friend even told me that I wouldn't be there with him as with younger people it tend to be more painfull and more fatal.

So in the end the only thing I have left is to accept my anxiety, but I don't know how, every time I want to believe is anxiety, something new comes out and make me doubt about my heart health, I'm literally going crazy.

Almost two years ago I had my first bout of anxiety for no apparent reason. One day it came and took hold of me and I spent more than a month in a daze without being able to leave the house or walk down the street...

Hopefully I managed to ""get over it"", but I feel that this period/stage marked my life as always. Now I live in fear and things that I liked to do before I have stopped doing or I don't do them for fear that it will make me anxious.

Among them, I always planned to travel as much as possible with family and friends the day I had a stable job and recurring income. Well, now I am in that situation but I do it for fear of getting anxiety outside the house, not being able to control it and the situation exploding.

My last check up in October seemed totally fine, then I got a call 2 weeks later saying something wasn’t right and it might be cancer. After 6 weeks of waiting and biopsies, it wasn’t cancer, but was the most advanced stage of precancer. I had surgery and got the “all clear for now.” I will have to be checked every 6 months for 3 years. 

I got a call to remind me that I need to come in soon and I’m just sort of freaking out. Knowing I’ll be waiting around for 2 weeks just expecting to see that number pop up and tell me it’s back or it’s cancer this time.

625,"Hi, I'm Peter, 20. Recently I've been thinking of bad things happening base on my intuition. Most of these bad things are related to my relationship with the people around me. I'm constantly thinking that they have something against me or they're betraying me. This started last year, 2022 after the restriction, because of the pandemic, loosened. I had a group of friends that I was with  and had a few drinks together, had fun, and typical stuff you do with your friends. After a fee months, I felt something was wrong. Even though they are not showing it, I feel it that they don't like me. I confronted them about it, and they said ""no"". But few days after that, someone told me what they've been saying about me. I felt betrayed and sad. After that unfortunate incident, I've been having trust issues and I trust my intuition more than ever. 

Now, I'm talking to someone. He's sweet and gentle. He works hard and is independent. He talks to me even though he's tired, I really feel that he's someone to keep. But today, I just felt that something's wrong. He called me but he didn't speak. I called him back but didn't answer. I texted him what's wrong, if he's okay. He answered me ""yupp"". That was it, not even an explanation. I don't know if I should tell this guy that what he did triggered my anxiety, and I suddenly felt that he's unto something. I don't want to think much about it because I actually like him.

640,"I’ve had anxiety for years, since I was very young, I remember being afraid of everything and having phobias of germs, getting sick, heights, flying, driving, certain foods, etc. I was constantly scared as a child and eventually as I went off to college when I was 16 I slowly learned to live with my anxiety. I tried new things, I slowly came out of my shell. When I hit 34.. everything came to a head, I had gone through a major divorce at 33, lived through COVID under constant fear, I was diagnosed with PCOS, was moving across the country in May and was the heaviest I had ever been May 2022. By August 2022 I had lost 70lbs in almost two months because I was so afraid to eat I was basically crying every single day. I couldn’t eat and refused to, my emetophobia was so strong I could barely move everyday. I was in the ER multiple times, having procedures and CT scans done and no one could find out what was wrong with me. 

It was then that I finally decided that I needed medication, I talked to a psychiatrist for the first time. I felt like a failure, I had been through so much but I couldn’t break this fear and horror of food. Therapy wasn’t helping and I had been so afraid of food that no one could get me to eat more than a bite or two for a whole day. I was prescribed medication because one of its side effects was to rise my appetite, and at first it didn’t work. I felt again, so defeated and exhausted. They put me on a higher dose.. and after a few weeks, I felt hungry. I had cravings again. I felt like finally eating and I was so famished, I finally ate a piece of pizza because the cheese looked so good I couldn’t not eat it.

September 2022 I decided to start going to the gym, I was scared at first, I only would go in for 20 minutes 3 times a week. I was so weak, I had lost all my muscle starving myself. 

October 2022 I went to the gym for the first time for an hour. I went up to the free weights and was discouraged, but then watched some YouTube videos and started building workouts. I walked my first mile without pain. I was eating 1,800 calories a day. I wasn’t as afraid. 

November 2022 I ate out at a restaurant for the first time in months! I had nachos and they were delicious. I wasn’t afraid! I had my colonoscopy and they found IBS and colitis. I finally had answers to my stomach pains. 

December 2022 I made a big Christmas dinner with my partner and roommate and I ate a full meal! I was now lifting at the gym 5 times a week. 

January 2023 I travelled out of the state on a plane! I ate out almost everyday! I enrolled back into school for my masters. 

February 2023 to now: I workout 5 days a week and I walk 2-3 miles every single day. I keep my body on a routine for my chronic illnesses and I eat a focused healthy diet everyday.

Some days are still hard, some days have anxiety.. some days my stomach hurts and I have flare ups randomly. But every bad day has five times better ones. I focus on the positive, I try not to be afraid of anything anymore. And even if I am? I remember it can’t hurt me, and I’ll be okay tomorrow.

Hello 20M and I quit vaping 3 months ago after vaping for 4 years and I have no plans on going back. Picked up this habit in high school (peer pressure) and it continued because I was in the same group of friends since then. Vaped here and there in high school and every damn day in college. Chain vaping 55 mg nic salt pretty much. Obviously this is my fault, but I can’t help but think my future is uncertain and I probably fucked up my health. My lung has been feeling weird for a few months now and it’s causing me anxiety. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to do anything in college that could help my career because I think I’m going to die in the near future. Like what’s the point. Im convinced I’m going to die from lung cancer sometime in the future or cardiac issues. I’ve been having chest pain and it’s scary. I take an snri rn and it’s helping but the thoughts won’t go away. It’s getting to the point where I’m reconsidering my whole life because I feel like I ruined it. I’m very depressed and anxious about it and I wish I knew vaping was absolutely terrible for you before I even started. I know this post may seem dramatic but this is what goes through my head every morning until I sleep. I keep thinking it wasn’t supposed to be this way. I’ve gotten straight As my entire life, been going to the gym, eating right. Im in college about to go into a career path that’s exciting and the future potentially could have been great but I have my one single vice that I was too stupid to quit.

Obv my parents don’t know about this they just think I’m very distressed and depressed about school or smt. I see all of my peers off doing amazing things with their lives and I’m just going through this bs. It’s pathetic the person I’ve become. Younger me would’ve died if he saw what I turned into. Throwing away life it seems like just for a little buzz. I’ve been trying to get my friends off this shit too but they prob see me as biased due to my health anxiety with vaping.They are great but I can’t help but feel I wouldn’t be in this situation if I stayed away from the red flags. Once one person starts doing it it’s like dominos and no one thinks twice about it being bad. Damn my whole life building up to smt and I just jeopardize it over bullshit.

I couldn’t even look at her or I’d just start shaking worse. 

I think the correlation to the cold is psychological. I walk into a cold room or get out of my warm bed and it starts, but usually only when I’m worried that it might happen to begin with.

664,"For context, I'm in high school. My anxiety has been super bad lately and it's been causing me to miss school a lot. My mom convinced me to go today and it was horrible.
My science teacher is a great teacher but he can be pretty harsh sometimes telling us our year is the worst, our generation is the worst, smirking when we do badly on quizzes. Despite all that stuff I really do respect him as a teacher and he's good at the material.
I just needed someone to vent to about him so I went to my counselor who I loved. She listened and offered insight but then I had to leave.
At the end of the day my science teacher pulls me aside and tells me that my counselor told him everything. He said she told him that I said stuff that he doesn't remember saying (it's definitely possible he doesn't remember but it did happen) and that I was holding on to stuff from the past which wasn't true as he says similar stuff pretty much daily. 
       The worst part is my counselor completely misunderstood one of my rants. She told him I was upset that he wasn't immediately able to help with something and that I had to wait. That wasn't at all true. And he said that he thought I would have understood so I explained she misunderstood and he seemed to believe me. I just think he believes I asked her to go to him for me so he's mad I didn't directly speak with him. He was really respectful one on one which I forget he is sometimes because of how he treats our class as a whole. I just feel really bad, I don't always agree with him but I never wanted to hurt anyones feelings. I was just going to someone I thought I could trust to talk things out. I'm not even really mad at my science teacher I'm just frustrated that my counselor went behind my back like that. I feel horrible though.

My brain seems over-active, like if I see someone pass next to my front window, it will make me flinch. If doorbell goes it can do that.

Would you say I have General anxiety?

\- Find it hard to show natural emotions, like smile etc. It's faked.

\- I am use to routines.

I'm hesitant to take any of it though, I don't want to feel dependent on meds and then when i stop taking them, the anxiety comes back.

My long term girlfriend and I broke up earlier in 2022, but we would sometimes keep in touch and see each occasionally. We went to college together, but didnt date in college, so alot of her friends are my friends also. She moved 6 hrs away for a job before we broke up and that was part of why we broke up, along with other things. It was easy being with her from the friends aspect but deep down inside there were some things that really bothered me about our relationship. We always tried to make it work but it just didn't. She ended things with me, but we are on good terms.

She recently told me that she is seeing someone, and ever since then it has bothered the hell out of me and have had all this anxiety since. Its making me think did I make the right decision in pretty much agreeing to break up, to the point we spoke on the phone and she said, sorry but it's over between us.

I have gotten anxiety bouts before but its always about job deadlines or things that once over the anxiety goes away. This is different, I know my relationship with her in a romantic way is over, and the severity of this anxiety is much worse than anything I have felt. before.

so this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home. it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it. the part that causes this isn't that 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll struggle even more with uni' but 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll en up in trouble by my dad'

ultimately i know it's always gonna be 'study for your own sake, not anyone else's' but after growing up with a father that's so abusive in so many ways, it's hard to not make that association and just break out until i can't even focus on studying

692,"I'll add a little background first, im a 35 year old male and have never had any diagnosed conditions or health problems in general. I have always been extremely shy, social + health anxiety, low confidence, never had a girlfriend, no friends since I moved to a different part of the country when I was about 22. Over time I think I have been able to numb it down, creating explanations and reasonings in my mind, and used video games as an escape. For the last 10 years or so, my life have been:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Wake up and eat breakfast

\- Go to work

\- Come home and shower

\- Make and eat dinner

\- Some kind of workout

\- Sit at computer

\- Sleep and repeat

\- Every other weekend I visit my mom, who I spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herself

&amp;#x200B;

But a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety, realizing what my life have been these last 10 years. I feel like I have wasted so much time, especially on the weekends where I was at home doing nothing, instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive. I got thoughts about existential dread, death and what our purpose really is. I got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her, and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me, understands me and that I can be myself with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an alcoholic over 10 years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next - now the video games do nothing for me, I can't ""escape"" and I'm lost for purpose. My appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing, especially when I try to sleep, which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that I can't stop. I keep thinking ""Am I sick? Am I going insane? Do I have a brain tumor?"" and many more thoughts of that kind. I also get this weird feeling somethimes of being ""disconnected"" or ""dissociated"" to the world. I become hyper-aware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird. In this state, I feel like im ""acting"" like myself, when I'm with others - like I'm something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a 3rd person view.

693,"Quick intro:
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving, i hate taking a shower, i hate exercising. You name it, if i makes me hot, i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.

Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.

However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear, and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.

Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.

Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.

At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. 

It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.

TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens

So i have been suffering from awful derealization/depersonalisation, anxiety, ocd, and panic attacks for a couple of years now but it’s always come and gone. Ever since last year after going through a traumatic event it’s shifted my entire life to now only being able to focus on my anxiety. there are days that i get better and days where i have bad flair ups. I actively go to therapy and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist and nutritionist to see if i could figure out how to solve all these issues especially the derealization as it causes me to feel so out of it and almost high 24/7 as it has been prevalent for the last year especially now. I have been prescribed zoloft before but I had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris. Recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe. Where I am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fear/ocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and I typically stay away from alcohol as I do not like how i feel when I drink. I am so scared to start meds or even vitamins that contain magnesium because I am so afraid of the “high” feeling or derealization feeling but now don’t know where to go from here.

For the past 3 years I have had some strange symptoms that are persistent, I have a pressure in my forehead, constant dizziness (room not spinning).

I had a brain MRI back in August 2021 without contrast which came back clear, but I do feel as though something may have been missed as I have the symptoms above.

711,"Hello! I'm a gym newbie here, and I've been *really* struggling with going to the gym. 
I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym, once I get a good daily routine in, once I get a job that starts later, so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.

Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way, even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then, too.

I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO self-conscious, to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting, I was focusing on being quiet, who could see me, how light my weights were, etc. I stared at the clock, couldn't talk louder than a whisper, clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.

Tried going just to treadmill the other day, walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. 

I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this, even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety, particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious -

- being near other people working out (?!?!)

- seeing my reflection in the mirror

- using light weights (THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao)

- how long it takes me to set up/figure out a machine

- maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me

- someone else using what I want and not know what to sub

- anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao

- my form (I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge me)

I'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is, but I wanted to hear yalls advice.

Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever, and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety, I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!",How did you overcome severe gym anxiety?,4

Hope you're all doing alright today :) 

I've suffered from overthinking and general anxiety for a while. Being in my final year of university has been overwhelming to the point where I started seeking professional help. My doctor prescribed some beta blockers to me and asked me to take them when necessary - I've not thought of taking them until today.

I think I hit my breaking point today. I have way too much to do and I haven't been able to manage things well. I felt some aches and tightness in my chest and throat, got cold hands and feet, and starting stress sweating (the smell was putrid). I could also feel my heart pounding in my chest. I decided to check my heart rate and I was surprised to find out that it was in the mid 50s. I didn't take my first dose of beta blockers and I'm waiting to speak to my doctor tomorrow.

We where told we basically had to choose are pathway as in our job, or related field anyways as of late I wanted to follow in my uncles path and become a personal investor, and since he's already high up I'd have a job lined up for me as i get outta high school and more, the only catch. "" I knew i had anxiety but ever since i choose what I wanted to do math is now associated with anxiety"" to make it worse I was labeled a troubled kid when i was younger in life so as a result we moved a lot, and I never had a long friendship making me easy targets for people who love drama. So as i was growing I was taking speical classes since I had bad adhd aswell, so I wasn't getting the right credited for really anything in life and was basically  labelled a special needs since they never put time into me. as a result i started trying better and Finally was able to upgrade to college level everything in grade 10 keep and keep in mind I was in high school in grade 8 due to this special program, and now they they teach me like any other kid. I've found it very hard to do anything since i grew up getting 1-1 attention, now since High school math is broken and 50% u will most likely never use in real life depending  on the career  you pick although the one i wanted to get into was ""money related"" I most diffidently don't need trig, etc anyways     "" I really need help finding out how to coop with anxiety, this only happens during math aswell, So i know the trigger, and i know hen i clam myself down and I'm very happy before math i do better during math. but for some reason anytime my teacher ignores me for example today "" I rasied my hand to kep my practice quiz checked nobody else had their hand up"" so i wait she see's says one second and goes to 5 different people none of them had their hands out and forgot that i eveen asked so i promptly left teh class and went outside to get air or i was gonna start crying for the stress, angry anxiety and everything why are my emotions 10x whenever i'm in math  is their even any way to fix this issue?""","I need some desperate help, and maybe some words of advice.",4
717,"I’m (F25) not sure how to write this. I’ve never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between (from what little I can remember) the ages of 7-15. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X.

1. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are see-through. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. 

2. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If I’m just out a shower and wearing a towel I’ll always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and I’m weak for being embarrassed about being naked. 

3. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door (caught them sometimes) before bursting in. 

4. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didn’t want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. 

5. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. 

6. X flashes me (still does) and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. 

7. X would insist on checking me ‘down there’ when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. 

8. X gets into my bed without asking when I’m in bed or when I’m not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. 


The next two are hard for me to type…I don’t feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic.  


9. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice (this cringes me so much so please don’t say anything nasty about this). Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said ‘aww my baby, do you want to suck milk’ and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I ….I can’t type the rest but I don’t think I need to.

10. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I don’t know if it’s in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel (or think I did) them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it.

735," 

I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$&amp; out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway, yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe. Why am I like this?",Can't think of a suitable name for this post,4
736,"Hi guys,

I've experienced anxiety for a long time now (26F), I'd say at least 8 years. Symptoms have always been tight chest, heart going a million miles an hour, the occasional panic attack. 

I've always managed it quite well, have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well. 

I've never let it stop me doing anything as then I'd feel like it has beat me.

As of 3 weeks ago (it was literally one day fine and the next.. NOT FINE!), I got on the train to go to work and felt like I was going to throw up. My mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat. At first I thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss. 

Even though I haven't thrown up and logic would indicate I'm not going to, it feels like I genuinely am on the verge everytime I am in a moving vehicle. 

I thought it would pass, but it's now just part of my everyday life and I'm finding it debilitating. I'm scared I'll lose my job because of it, which is feeding into the anxiety even more. The only way I can get through a train journey (or any moving vehicle for that matter) is by closing my eyes and putting on Bob Marley through my headphones. It's quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way I can slightly manage it. 

I've never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages, but now it's became a THING. 

I have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real. 

Has anyone else experienced a sudden and drastic change in anxiety symptoms, how do you manage them? I'm scared I'll be this way forever.",Quick change in anxiety symptoms?!,4
737,"Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here, and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!

I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May, wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever, I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life, mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine (anti depressants) for the last 2 years, this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.

Anyway, cutting to now... Since the very (very) start of the year, just after new years... (obviously) I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before, It was as though now I felt it full blast, and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else, and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this, I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing (he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft, believe me) so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it, as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way (although he's always telling me how perfect I am) It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...

fast forward a few days, I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection, or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to, if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me (even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before) after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional, may even start crying and it's difficult to stop, I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?

I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship, I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years, also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc, I also feel these emotions.

As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around, but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in, as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? (think that's the word) which would cause more anxiety for me, my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling, even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat (I'm feeling this pretty much everyday)

the past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as ""I don't love you"" and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real, having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else, this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections, where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way, is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.

I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship (a month or so) with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.

I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in, but this is just the summary of it...

Please can I get real responses with this, I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now.",Constant anxiety and have lost feelings for partner?,4

Is it normal for people to feel attraction to other people while they're in relationships? I certainly think other men are attractive, I won't lie.

741,"Hey guys,

the last days after i got officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder i went without any symptoms (i guess finaly having a name for my problems calmed me down).

But two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt :/

It not a stinging pain or something that i can't manage, but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think??

It also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzy/out of myself right now :(

I went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain, so It shouldn't be my kidneys right?

This dizziness scares me so much though :(

Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

Or maybe i should really call an ambulance?

Hey there! I hope this is the right place to post about this. I don't know anyone irl who deals with so much anxiety so here we go.

Since last summer I've been dealing with a lot of intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my relationship/my partner/me etc which caused a lot of anxiety. From july all the way through december I felt like I was going crazy. I felt so much anxiety and so much emotional pain to the point where I thought I couldn't function properly. I would've done anything to stop feeling anything at all. And everything between me and my partner was fine, I didn't have any reason to feel like this.

In january I started to feel a bit better (anxiety wise), but I started to self harm again (I don't do this constantly, only once or twice every few months I guess). In january and february I felt so sad and so numb that I didn't care about anything anymore. I think I also experience suicidal thoughts but I am very afraid to die so idk if I actually do experience them. I still feel a little bit anxious and I do experience self harm thoughts here and there but overall I can function decently. 

I've never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist and so idk where I should start. The thing is, therapy is very expensive and I can't afford it right now. I could afford going to a psychiatrist tho, but i don't know if my situation is that bad in order to reach out to a psychiatrist. I am scared they won't take me seriously and that they will tell me to go to therapy instead.

If I had asked for a ride I think it would have been worse because he would have felt pressured to drive me which again would not be great since he asked for space a while back. 

I was feeling like the call was a sign to go out and I didn’t. So I was feeling down on myself for choosing to miss out. But now that I know I probably could not have gotten a ride anyway somehow I feel better lmao

How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal, as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?

I've been worried about the environment for years, especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.

In order not to be crushed with worry, I held onto the idea that, at worse, our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

Hey all, 
For context I’m 17F and in week 4 of 1L, so have just started law school. 

However, these past three years, but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I’d get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn’t home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn’t see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. 

Anyways, this was in November of 2022. I got through exams, and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear, I was surrounded by family and didn’t have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 2020-2022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. 

So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety, panic attacks, derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro, which I’ve been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided I’d push through, and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. It’s been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion, unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. I’ve spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. 

Besides the mental strain I’ve been under, there’s also been physical and health issues I’ve been dealing with, being hyperthyroidism, and as of a week ago, iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop, but I don’t want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose, of validation. 

I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance :)",Thinking of deferring law school due to mental health and burn out. Really need advice and support,4
816,"I had a complete breakdown in December, nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life.  I am mid 30s, and my therapist said I have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma, with my mother being the largest chunk.

The ER trip in December involved barking ""Help"" but feeling like I wasn't the one saying it, and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating, and intense heart palpitations.

The heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about 7 years ago as well, and I remember doing similar when I was a young kid.

I had another panic attack last week, and my anxiety has been up and down.  Hydroxyzine for panic instances, and prozac to keep me level.

My mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high:  it's a stroke, a heart attack, a tumor, an uncurable/unknown disease.

Thanks to therapy, I'm no longer depersonalizing/derealizing, but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations, fear, and cold/hot feelings.

The medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two, but only for a week.  But now, I have had a handful of ""simple"" auditory hallucinations, such as a drum beat, a beeping sound, or the sound of water pouring, all of which are coming from in my head.

Has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent?  Work has been a stressor too, but my mom was the trigger, and work was the icing.  For months before this, I was frequently tired and not hungry at all, and always stressed at work, and had a short temper.

Long term Klonopin??

I am a 20 y/o male with fairly bad anxiety. Have tried every ssri in the book none of them work and give me horrible side effects. 

My anxiety is as follows: completely random attacks, feel like I’m dying I went to the er many times. I can’t process thoughts in my head pretty much 24/7 (hard time holding conversation). I will sometimes have attacks with stressful situations at work, but I have an important job so I don’t let those attacks stop home from doing my job even tho it can be miserable. 

I have tried many different ssri, hydroxzyine which works sometimes. The only thing that has worked is Xanax. I’m prescribed 1mg, but I typically break it up and take .25-.5 as needed. The only thing I haven’t tried is a beta blocker which I will try next.

Xanax allows me to have a perfectly clear head. I don’t feel like a retard and trip over my words and feel disassociated when I am on it. I don’t feel sedated or tired I just feel normal. It curbs and prevents panic attacks for usually 6-10 hours. I have been taking it more than I should recently .25-.5 every day to every other day. I do notice some rebound anxiety on the days off but nothing too crazy.

If a beta blocker doesn’t work I will try clonazapam. I really don’t care about dementia later in life. So my question is if these drugs increase my quality of life dramatically should I really avoid them just because of withdrawls? Yes I know their hell but you don’t go through them if you are on em for long term with no intention of getting off.

826,"I (25f) have been dating my boyfriend (33m) for two years now. We haven’t really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about 4 months ago. I’ve had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with ADHD in January. My anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now, which I definitely took for granted. I’m on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level. 

About 4 months ago, my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason. Okay, great, I’m working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it, but my overall mental health is still going downhill. My boyfriend, luckily for him, has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me. I’ve been working really hard to communicate with him about how I’m feeling and what I need, but he really just ignores it. 

For example, in January we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it. Traveling generally heightens my anxiety, especially international travel. A lot of little things happened (including a couple small actions he made) one day that led to an anxiety attack, and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening. A couple hours after I came down from the attack and I had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit, I talked to him about it a bit. I said “you can correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you don’t know how to respond or support me when I’m having really bad anxiety moments like this,” he said yeah that’s true, so I asked if it would be helpful if I told him a couple things that help when I’m really struggling. He agreed, so I said a few things like getting me some cold water, giving me a hug/holding me, taking a walk with me if that’s an available option, things like that. He said he could work with that. Over the past two or so months since then, I’ve had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one I had in January, and every time he basically ignores my anxiety. I’ve repeated my request a couple times, but it doesn’t make any difference. (There are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well.) 

Over the weekend, we had a very short conversation (probably 5 minutes max) and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say. (None of this is necessarily in order, I really don’t remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting.) I said I wanted to try to make it work. I asked him if he wanted to try to make it work, and his response was “I want you to be happy, and I don’t want to be taking that from you whether it’s because I’m not putting the effort in or unable to support you, or something else.” Which didn’t actually answer my question (I guess it did in a roundabout way, though). I also asked if he still loved me, and he paused for what felt like forever before saying “yes.” 

I’ve spent more time crying in the past two weeks than I have my entire life before this. 

I’ve been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months. He’s not a very talkative person in general. If there’s an issue, he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesn’t actually bring it up. I feel like not only am I the only one that tries to open communication lines, but that I’m not getting my needs met also. 

I’ve talked to my therapist about it a bunch, and I think I’ve pretty much made my decision: I’m going to break up with him and work on my mental health. 

It feels terrible sitting on this, knowing the relationship is coming to an end. I have some major events coming up at work this week (including a 4 day long audit that I’m in charge of) so I’m basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible (I.e. the end of the week) and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work. Either way, I’m not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work, I’m just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner. 

I’m struggling with feeling like I’m broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety. I know that’s not actually the case, but it sure feels that way. 

Anyway, thank you for listening. All my family lives out of state and I only have a couple friends, none of which I really talk about deep stuff like this with. I just want a hug.

827,"Hi all,

30/m/New York

This post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing. 
Might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who has/is going through anything similar. 

I have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently.

4 months ago I had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack. The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. 

A couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work, EKG, echo etc. All results came back fine, as expected, except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse (53 most of the time) and the chest tightness remained. 

Over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent (twice a week) and my chest tightness began to disappear.

I managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that I’m not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. 

I had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didn’t find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.

More recently, my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. 
I have been feeling heart palpitations a lot, or more accurately, my heart skipping beats.
I began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point, causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. 

Now I’m obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.
 
I have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and won’t get the results back for another 10 days or so. 

And this is where I am at…
Frequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me, give me a stroke or make me faint.

Anyone else gone through this? 

Thanks!",Heart/health anxiety,4

834,"Hello everyone I hope you’re okay!

So from January 24th up to know I have fallen back into my anxious state. 

It all started when I went to the big city in January I hadn’t felt anxious in months and I love the city so didn’t expect it. When I was walking off my train all the way down to the shopping centre I felt my legs and they didn’t feel ‘normal’ not weak but not strong and I was really aware of them and felt like my legs would just fail to walk and I’d fall over. The more I walked the more I started to stress out it got to the point where I felt dizzy and a bit lightheaded cause I was panicking and BOOM it hit I’m think OMG am I going to pass out ! I started to panic and think maybe it was diabetes but I’m a slim 22 year old male with no health conditions but in the moment I was panicking it was horrible so derealised and the fear of impending doom ! And then 3 days later I imagine because my nervous system was stimulated I was at my grans putting her bins out and for no apparent reason 0-100mph panic attack my legs instantly out of nowhere felt weak ish and shaky and so didn’t my arms and I let out this big exhale and I felt off balance and kind of dizzy in my head I rushed out the house into the car and sat there for a minute and I was okay but walking from my car to the house again made it happen mildly. Fast forward to today 20th of June i am still struggling with anxiety. Not the instant panic attack weak legs. This is like a head pressure feeling kinda like I’m tilting my head. Anyway I get this when I go on walk and panic and think I’m gonna pass out or fall over and then I think it’s something serious. I am also getting. It in shops. Although I have been in 4 shops the past few days just to ivercome this feeling. The past two times I had it very mild but made it without a panic attack and rushing out. B  it because of this and headaches ( I want to say all my symptoms don’t hurt and they aren’t terrible they are 3/10  maybe 4.5/10 when panicking in terms of intensity but i still panic thinking I’m gonna fall to the ground or pass out. HOW DO I GET OVER THIS because I’m currently thinking I have a brain tumour. Basically all I want is reassurance that it’s anxiety and it’s not high blood pressure (had blood pressure check at doctors this year after walking there and it was fine) diabetes( I had general blood tests before and I didn’t have diabetes I am also a slim male 22) brain tumour ( head pressure and headaches making me think. Fairly certain I had similar dizziness years back when my anxiety was at my peak and my doctor kept telling me no brain tumour about 3 years ago. Also I’m scared of having low iron but I guess I just eat more iron and I’ll be okay ? Please let me know what you think. I have had 6 heart tests from three years ago up until now and it’s fine!

Thank you in advance

I am also starting to feel my heart rate again to check it and it’s stressing me out and making me more aware of it!

**Afternoon**: Tension builds up and I feel stiff and uncomfortable for no reason. Or have an adrenaline dump around this time

**Early Evening**: Can be 50-50. Either I feel fine or symptoms start up again and last for a bit

**Late evening**: Right at around 11pm or so some chemical switch goes off in my body and 80% of my issues vanish. It gets easier to breathe, my Heart slows down, and my brain fog lifts. Start feeling much happier too and its very obvious the constant subconscious anxiety has lifted. I have always been a night owl and even before my panic disorder I had weird spurts of energy and motivation in the late evening which made me a productivity machine in the AM. 

**Sleep**: I can sleep relatively ok but if something startles me and wakes me up I have a full on panic attack. I get at least 7h of sleep daily.

847,"I (29M) started dating my girlfriend (24F) around 3 months ago. Almost a month ago we became officially boyfriend/girlfriend, and since then my anxiety has sky-rocketed. 

At the start I used to be pretty confident, always trusted her etc, but now I’m struggling. She has given me 0 reason not to trust her, but I’m always thinking worst case scenario. She is on her phone? Probably talking to another guy. She goes out with her friends? Probably cheating on me. Yesterday we were together in bed and I saw she was looking at some photos on her phone, and could see on the photo reel some pictures I didn’t recognize. The background was red, and that was everything I could actually see (I was without glasses). I immediately started thinking that those pictures are probably with a random guy, and that she is cheating on me. I mean, even if they were photos with someone else (which I don’t even know if they were photos of her/screenshots/ a random thing etc), she can have photos with friends without me thinking this. 

I know this is not healthy, and while I haven’t showed her my anxiety, I’m sure at some point I will mess up and she will probably start distancing herself. I mean, this reeks controlling behavior, right? I even had some issues with my bank that I thought she caused (not at all). This is my second relationship, my first was not great but my ex never cheated or anything, so I’m not sure what is causing this. Could it he that Im insecure? Or just don’t want to lose her? My gf is awesome and I really enjoy our relationship so far. She is attentive, shows interest, always makes time for us, cooks for me etc. I feel loved.

It is worth noting that I almost screw everything up at the beginning, as I broke up with her before we were oficial for another girl. I realized my mistake shortly after and she accepted me back (after apologizing and having a deep conversation with her). I’m constantly thinking that I don’t deserver her after that, and that if I were her, who knows if I would have taken me back. Could this be part of it?

TL:DR: I (29M) started dating my gf (24F) over 3 months ago. She has given me 0 reason to not trust her, but I’m constantly anxious thinking the worst (that she is talking with other people, cheating on me etc). This makes me fear I will eventually become very controlling. How can I address this?",I’m (29M) having bad anxiety in new relationship,4
848,"ever since i was maybe 10-11, ive had an irrational fear of carbon monoxide poisoning. its gotten better now that im older, but it used to be so bad to the point where i would refuse to sleep some nights because i was convinced that i would die in my sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning, and that i wouldnt be able to hear the alarm going off if there ever was a leak.

i currently have one CO detector in my house (a battery operated one), and its in my living room. i recently read somewhere that CO detectors (at least the first alert ones, which is the kind i have) are only effective for about 5-7 years. i unplugged mine and checked the back and saw that the date of manufacture was march 2nd, 2016, which was almost exactly 7 years ago. although the alarm hasnt given the end of life warning yet. i even tested it to see if it was still working, and it was, although there was no green or red light. dont know if that means its not receiving power, or what, or if thats normal. 

its currently 11pm, so i cant really go out and buy another CO detector right now. im just scared that there will be a leak or something tonight, and that my detector wont go off and i'll die in my sleep, along with my pets. i know its extremely unlikely that there will be a CO leak tonight, but i cant help but think about it. i'll probably buy another detector tomorrow if im able to. im terrified right now. i feel like this is such a stupid thing to be afraid of, and im not really sure why ive been afraid of it for so long. any reassurance would be very much appreciated.

Day 1/30 20.03 ✅

 • Overall, this day was easy for me, I didn’t experience any headaches from my new no-sugar-no-caffeine diet, my mind felt more a bit less stressed than yesterday though I slept 6 hours at night(I accidentally ate one sweet oopsies)But I had a public speech and my body responded with a fight or flight response☠️ Public speaking is one of those things that I want to master by dealing with my anxiety issues…

Day 2/30 21.03 ✅

 • Lmaoo today I did feel those headaches after cutting caffeine. They were not so strong, though. I definitely feel less anxiety, but not so much. My legs almost died when I was running and my sneakers are dirty af(the weather conditions in my city are ☠️)Anyway, I did well.

 • I took a test so I can track my anxiety. I got 11/38 score, it was a social anxiety test because sometimes I start worrying when I talk with people🥲The test results say that my anxiety level is considered as low, and that’s true, but I want to feel 100% confident around any person and in any situation. Public speaking still awakens in me fear of being judged, so it’s still a big way to go.

Day 3/30 22.03✅

 • It was really hard to get up from bed and I don’t know why, maybe because of cutting sugar. Meditated twice in the morning because yesterday I accidentally fell asleep while wanting to take a nap… Omg my legs hurt so much when I run🤩Today I feel more stable than before this project and even yesterday as if my inner psychological core or something has grown stronger… I stopped worrying about little things that always bothered me before this challenge. For example, I stopped hesitating to talk to handsome guys😹

Day 4/30 23.03✅

• I probably won’t run today, my legs are sore. I stopped having mood swings🫢Feel much more relaxed than ever before. Things really bother me much less. I just stopped thinking random negative thoughts. My hands used to shake from stress sometimes, now it doesn’t happen.(upd no it still does)I had little eczema caused by my nervousness on the back of my hand, now it’s completely gone. Headaches don’t bother me, I don’t crave sweets, but I started to eat much more.

Day 5/30 24.03✅

• I feel really good🥺I started to understand my anxious thoughts and emotions and realised how I used to repress them, their symptoms (rapid heartbeat, trembling hands). It’s funny how they’re going away now when I noticed my resistance towards them. Like, I used to get annoyed and try to control my body when my hands started shaking or tried to calm down my heart when I get worried, now I just… let go of control. Today I also didn’t run, instead I walked 6kms on a high speed. I don’t mean to ruin the challenge, it just seems like I injured my legs.

I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasn’t an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just don’t understand why didn’t snap out of it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training (ironically) and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment came rushing back. I didn’t think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn’t keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I’m not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don’t normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn’t even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he’s not worried about me dying then maybe I’m not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‘a little bit of anxiety’. 

Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then I’ve had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as I’m scared it’s going to happen in public and now I’m being referred to therapy so I’m not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless.

872," **TL;DR: Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been, plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited**

Backstory: I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit (different profile). The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third most-viewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.

I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.

For many years, the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of ""bring together the best players"" event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luck-based (but if you're like me, you can sort of manipulate your odds). This year, a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting ""fan favorite"" players in person, most of whom went viral in the same way I did.

15 people were invited, and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out, I got several messages from fellow players asking me, ""Did you get invited to the thing?"". Many in the community were shocked I was not, and one of them said ""They're missing out without you"". When I found out this was happening, I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted (I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media). One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted, I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the de-facto ""GOAT trio""; we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time, though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity, but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.

The ""reunion"" happened today, and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO, but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May, so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.

Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course, and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others; I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay, and I found him very attractive (as did many others in our community). Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person (across the country) and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together (e.g. sitting on a different couch) and excluded me from ""parties"" he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us, and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew, knowing it would turn me on, among many other forms of leading me on, but never had the courage to say ""I don't like you like that"". Instead, he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him, saying it was inappropriate behavior (behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me, and said ""It's different with them"" when I asked). We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends, but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months, and when we did speak, it was only because he had a question about the game.

I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted, and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of ""reenacting"" the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name, and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion, I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him, because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said, I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends, because I do think he is a good person.

I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.

873,"Recently I got a fairly nice gift for a friend's birthday (\~$40 worth) which isn't an extravagant gift, but definitely the nicest gift I've given in this particular friend-group.

Unfortunately, my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a (relatively) nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex.... I REALIZE THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.... as most of my anxiety is.

So this became a trigger for a multi-week bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another......... and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and I'm afraid of losing one of my closest friends.

I've been to the ER three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms (in addition to high blood pressure) and all three times, my blood work and ECG have been normal.

I need to add, a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down, and got better when sitting up or walking.

In light of that last detail, the ER doctors said ""it's just GERD"" and sent me home with orders for a PPI medication and a Blood Pressure medication.

Well, the GERD has improved, and all the symptoms I've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.

907,"TL;DR: Dad gave me edible without my knowledge/consent, I had a really bad trip, now I don't know how to deal with it.

Hey, not sure if this is the best place to post this. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for exactly - to vent? To know if someone had a similar experience? I don't know.

Last month I was staying at my dad's house. One night, I was sitting in the living room while he and his wife were in the kitchen nearby. I wasn't paying any attention to them; I was playing a video game on my dad's laptop. I had headphones on, with one ear uncovered because I was also watching The Simpsons. So I didn't know what they were talking about.

My dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy. I don't remember if I asked what it was; whether I did or not, he was just like ""Try it."" Now, the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isn't unusual; I'm used to him making me try weird foods and such. So, perhaps foolishly, I ate it without really questioning it (it tasted vile). It was only after I had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible.

Now, another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me. Once, when I was a teenager, for example, he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didn't. So I wasn't sure if he was lying or not. I knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles, I just...didn't know they had any at the time. I had never done drugs before, and I don't think I would have eaten it if I had known.

After that, he and his wife went to bed. About an hour or so passed, then it began kicking in. I started feeling dizzy, and I got kind of scared, so I went into their bedroom and I asked my dad if it really was an edible. He said ""No."" This was a lie, but obviously I didn't know it at the time.

I decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep. There was only one bedroom, so I had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner. So I was lying there, crying because I had no idea if what I was feeling was because I was high or if it was all in my head.

My dad's wife was also high, and she started talking to me. I started laughing, things got kind of funny...I started talking about all of my interests (much to my dad's annoyance, as he was trying to sleep), and I said some really embarrassing things (I later found out he had recorded at least most of what I said...well, yelled, 'cause apparently when I'm high I get really loud). I have selective mutism, so I tend to have a lot of trouble talking if I'm not really comfortable (it's gotten better over the years, but my dad is convinced that I don't actually have it or something)...

Anyway, at some point, I fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare. It's hard to describe, but it involved me forgetting everything...my life, my interests, the people I knew and the world around me...I dreamt that my dad knew I was going to forget it all, and I remember the fear I felt in the nightmare. Just that feeling of...""Why? Why would he do this to me?"" I tried to recall faces - mine, my dad's, a musician I have a crush on (yeah, weird, I know)...and everything was warped, grotesque. Everything became a black void (you know that scene in Spongebob where Squidward's in that ""Alone"" place? Kind of like that, except black instead of white). I began thinking that maybe I had died, or was dying, and that this horrible void was the afterlife.

I woke up sobbing and screaming ""Oh God!""/""Oh Lord!"" over and over (and also yelling at my dad ""How could you do this to me!?"" and ""I will never forgive you!"") He and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water. Everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that I was trying to wake up from.

My dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists (American Murder Song). In my disoriented state, I remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar, and that if I could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay. I vaguely remember singing along to the songs.

After I ate he put on one of my favorite movies (Repo! The Genetic Opera) and left me in the living room. I remember it being on, but it felt almost like I was half asleep or something throughout. I was just anxious and confused, and I was trying to focus on the movie but I kept...I don't know, it was like going in and out of consciousness or something. There's a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and I remember vaguely wondering if perhaps I was actually her (I'm a guy, not that it mattered to my drugged self) and that I would wake up and the movie would be reality.

Apparently, I also sang along to the whole move, but I don't remember this (my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said I seemed to be having a great time, but I know I really wasn't). I do remember, however, that at some point I threw up all over myself. After the movie, I told my dad I threw up and he was mad that I was too disoriented to clean it up myself. By this point, about six hours had passed since I had taken the edible. I remember being so confused I asked him what day it was. After that, I went back to sleep.

The next day, my dad told me that it really was an edible...so I did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way. But for about three days afterward I still felt the affects of it...and for about a week or so I kept experience derealization.

My dad's reason for giving me the edible...he said he thought it would make me talk more...which it did, but it was humiliating. Apparently, he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible, but (as my cousin pointed out to me) it's strange to just assume that I'd be paying attention to a conversation that I wasn't even part of, even if I was in the room. So he apparently thought I knew what it was...

I wasn't able to go home immediately (he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that), but when I eventually did I told my mom what happened. She's furious at my dad, though neither of us have spoken to him about it. I talked to my therapist about it recently, but her reaction seemed...dismissive (like, she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests, but again...I had no consent).

So here I am, exactly a month after it happened...I still experience derealization if I think about it (parts of the nightmare I mentioned I literally only remembered last night...). I just...I don't know how I'm going to get over this. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to, for example, watch ""Repo!"" again...just recently I listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. I'm trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dad...(this isn't the first time I've thought about it, to be honest, but I'm seriously considering it now). I just know now that thinking about that nightmare still terrifies me...",A month ago I was drugged without my consent (long post)...,4

920,"By tomorrow night, I (21 y/o UK university student) have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far; the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes, vague ideas and research over the last few months, but I don't have a clue what to do with it, or where to start.

I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life, and until a few weeks ago, I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago, my motivation, self-belief and general ability to work (which were all low to begin with anyway) just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it). I missed the second one because of the same reasons, and because I failed the first one, so it didn’t make a difference if I missed the second one.

Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow (Tuesday), I've not only not been working on the dissertation, but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I don’t like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it (literally and mentally) because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me (it was my choice after all) and i’ve done a lot of research (too much I think) and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this (which is every time i’ve ever done an assessment in my three years at university) it usually turns out alright, but I can't see how this one — of course, the most important one — will end in anything other than failure. So I’ve come all this way — from the start of uni three years ago, from the start of reception 17 years ago — and I've always, at the very least, managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.

I’m aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time, or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all, and will all, get through it, and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they’re focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I’m not one of them. I know that I don’t belong here, and I don’t like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure — the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally — and that's what’s driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to, never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.

So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career — I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future — short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it’s “where do you see yourself in five years”, “what do you want to do with your life"" or even simply “do you have any plans for the weekend”, I’ve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I’ve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I’ve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don’t remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.

In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because…well…where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years). I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.

If anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far — and if you are a healthy, ‘normal’ person — you will have obviously thought to yourself, “Yeah, he needs therapy”. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There’s a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help…from anyone in fact. I think that’s the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I’d hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don’t think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. Is it because of a deep-rooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably ‘need’ help with — health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation — I don't care about help, or support, or self-improvement. I don’t want any of it because I think it won’t work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. I don’t want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.",I don't know what to do. I don't know how to do it. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going.,4
921,"Just a vent tbh .

I've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older, I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. Ironically even therapy scares me as I'm not really one to ""open up"" in front of others in fear of burdening/boring them. Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought

On the topic of skills, I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills. I've always been told I'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. When I'm honest about not being intelligent, understandably people think I'm fishing for compliments.  Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent

As well, my social skills are horrendous. I'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause I'm just so boring and unfunny. I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. I like art but again I'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. I'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still can't move a car without sweating buckets, shaking and struggling to control it, even moving off is so challenging.  I'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. I'm bad at sports, games , mediocre at cooking and just about everything I've tried. Heck I can't even ride a bike

I couldn't list a single talent I have. Anything I'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. For example I'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. There just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for me

My anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. I sit on the bus with my hood on so I'm not looked at. Even when I briefly had a job, I couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. It was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me

I can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there. But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way

Usually when im in peak anxiety i go on a few hours listening to music and crying in a dark room bender while smoking to much In the process...

I do meditation a trying to walk 2-3 hours a day but I fucking hate sports and I'm lazy...

927,"i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine about work settings because i will be having an internship soon. we talked about standard work things and tips, but then it lead to talking about my anxiety.

i asked, ""if i'm unable to speak because of anxiety, how do i communicate that to them?"" 'them' being my coworkers. for extra context, i think this is a common thing but just in case, my throat closes up to a degree that it becomes hard to and painful to breathe or speak. obviously i need to breathe, so i've learned to tough through it, and even so i was able to get an appointment with someone who may be able to help this issue. as for speaking, that can be even more painful than breathing, so i usually try to tap my throat with my finger and hold up one finger with the other hand to try to communicate that i need a minute and i can't breathe/speak.

i was worried that may not be enough, and i had previously told my friend about my issues. i figured he'd be the right guy to ask, especially since he's training to become a therapist. i guessed he may have some ideas i haven't thought about yet

he told me to tell my coworkers i need a minute to think and to maybe say it directly. i asked him, ""if i can't talk, how do i say it to them directly?"" i'm bad with conveying tone, partially because i'm autistic, so i can see in hindsight that it may have come off wrong.

he asked me if i was just going to leave or stay quiet without telling them what was going on, and he also said that the situation would just become worse. i was starting to get a bit upset and i said that i knew that. *then he told me to learn how to force myself to say it.*

that's where i became really upset. i have no idea if this was justified or not, all i know is how much it hurt. i tired my best to remind him of some of my tics, and how if i'm stressed enough to be unable to speak, forcing myself would DEFINATELY make the situation worse. i told him about how there's been times where i've gotten overwhelmed and anxious, which led to me accidently hitting someone rarely or most commonly myself. sometimes i'll have really bad ones which make me yell, fling my arm beside my head, or slam a fist down on a table.

i then apologized. he then told me that it's unfair, but i have to vocalize that kind of thing. i worked some things out with another close friend of mine, and we both agreed that i should maybe carry around some laminated cards on a ring with common words and sayings to help me communicate. we also talked about telling my coworkers and employers beforehand about my issues, and how i need a few minutes to myself to calm down.

i tried messaging the friend from before, saying that i wanted to talk. i apologized for getting upset and explained that i was hurt by what he said and that i was hoping we can talk about it all. i apologized again. i've seen he's read the message, but he hasn't responded. i'm a bit worried, but trying to be patient with out differing time zones.

should i force myself to talk when i am unable to, especially with some of my issues? i want to believe i'm not at fault, but i feel horrible about getting upset and i'm wondering if he's right and i should just try to suck it up.

**edit:** i also worry that i may have overreacted and blown up over something unimportant. it's just so infuriating and hurtful because i've been told all my life to force myself to do things and to just toughen up and deal with it. i've been called overly emotional and at this point any slight indication someone thinks that way kind of sets me off. i'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, i struggle putting these things into words.","should i force myself to talk when i am unable to? //vent, about work and conflict with friend + my issues //",4

940,"hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed, but after all the research ive done, this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed, if it's not a fast/immediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time, right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course, but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically, and whether you took it as needed or daily. 

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion.

950,"am a 19-year-old college student, trying to make the best of my life despite my past. Growing up, I had a difficult childhood. My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons. I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone, but it never worked.

My mom was an alcoholic, and she never showed me any love or affection. She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life. I felt like I was all alone in the world, and I had no one to turn to.

As a result of my childhood, I developed a deep sense of trust issues. I find it hard to open up to people and let them in. I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way, just like my father and stepfather did.

But despite all of this, I refuse to let my past define me. I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me. College has been a fresh start for me, and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me.

However, even with my newfound friendships, I still find it hard to trust people. I am always on guard and keep people at arm's length, afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did.

Sometimes, I wish I could forget about my past and start anew, but it's always there in the back of my mind, haunting me. It's hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today.

955,"The last job I had was back in October 2021 doing low-skilled IT work at a hospital and I got fired (worked there two months - the longest I’ve ever held a job). 

I’m in my early 20s and it’s embarrassing to admit that but it’s true. I can’t keep a job. I either quit after a short while, or in this instance, get chucked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I’ve avoided work all together as all I feel is bitterness and shame. Another deterrent is how I’m not good at anything in particular. All I can get are shit jobs where I’m completely replaceable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m too shy and anxious all the time, so talking to people is really hard. When I worked at a cinema it wasn’t too bad because there were people my age and I felt good talking to them, but that job went to pieces because management hated me (long story). 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m told to get a skill, but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as I’ve worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who I really wouldn’t get along with/tolerate. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I’ve done for the past year is read, write, listen to music and occasionally socialise but I’m pretty much alone now. I guess when you’re socially isolated it’s hard to really know yourself, like you can’t test yourself much in a public setting so it’s hard to truly know who you are. I find it hard sometimes. Just thinking about what jobs would suit me, it seems impossible. I know what I don’t want to do, but that’s pretty much everything to be honest. The idea of working a job again, commuting, forcing myself to speak to people who I don’t want to be around, and doing these mundane things feels like death isn’t so bad. Considering the sort of jobs I can get, which are garbage service jobs or low-skilled office one’s with high turnovers. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I’m stuck. I feel really trapped. The job centre is harassing me and I hate going in there as I feel like such a low-life… but on the same token I can barely afford the upkeeps for my car so I’ll have to work some shit job soon I suppose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not on medication or anything, I feel embarrassed typing this out. I’m scared of telling anyone my problems as I was always told they’re insignificant and I should “man up” (even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how I’m doing). So whatever. Seeing a GP in this country is a joke anyway so there’s zero point trying to get help anyways. I tried to be ambitious and maybe move countries but I don’t even have any qualifications, like I don’t have a degree so my options are very limited. I’d love to move countries and just forget about how bad my life sucks here but I can’t do that regrettably so I guess I’ll have to accept my lot in life working these miserable hapless jobs until I eventually murder myself or go crazy",Haven’t worked a job in a year and a half (pitiful rant),4

Last year, about this same time I got Covid, probably the worst thing I have ever gone through in my entire life, besides the horrible sickness part, somehow it sparked some sort of new anxiety in me. Before it I never experienced anxiety like I do now, but somehow it came on painfully out of no where. Panic attacks more than once a day, unable to control my thoughts, horrible intrusive thoughts, nightmares, insomnia, constant fidgeting &amp; some anger/irritability for no reason at all. 
After a month or two from healing from Covid (Covid long haul) I was getting better, no more panic attacks, able to drive, get out and be happy. I was okay, till now. One night I woke up a little too early so I decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours, and boom it was back. My mind went straight back to the anxiety, the irritability and pain as before but without the anxiety.
It’s been a few weeks or so now since it started and I feel so tired and mentally drained.

963,"14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven’t felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn’t and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn’t feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can’t describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn’t feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn’t conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn’t process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn’t show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don’t know what, because that’s the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn’t hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don’t have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

977,"I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues.

I don’t typically share on here and I’m unfamiliar with Reddit but my partner suggested I give it a go. I experienced something this morning and I believe it to be related to my anxiety. 
I woke up and started completing my typically morning routine, all was well. I came to the end of the list of things I have to do in my head. I left very sick to my stomach. I’ve been trying to become more aware of my anxiety symptoms and have noticed they often show as tummy issues. Typically physical, both feeling like I need to vomit and poop my pants. I ran to the bathroom and vomited. I had to reach out to my boss and explain the situation. I woke with children. I was also informed and asked about my colleague, whom I work with directly, they were possibly going to be out for the day as well causing a staffing issue. 
I feel guilty and a lot of other emotions about the situation. It feels like I let my team down. I also have a tendency to think and help others without thinking about  myself in the process.

979,"Hey guys! 

I’ve been following this community for a while, and I just wanted to share my story and maybe meet some people going through or who have been through a similar situation. I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. 

I’m 21, and growing up wasn’t easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could’ve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.

I'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. 

Thank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress.

992,"i’m a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma, mom, uncle, aunt, and little sister.

my mom has a meth addiction and she’s developed schizophrenia from it and it’s been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think it’s schizophrenia. my mom doesn’t take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so (realistically she’s been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out) recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i don’t know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesn’t talk to anyone, sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room, but he doesn’t yell and scream like my mom does, he’s just very quiet and intense. 

so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead, and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because i’ve seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how  she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how she’s constantly was thinking about me and she doesn’t think i’m safe. so i looked and my aunt (she’s mentally well) sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. 

the message said “*uncles name* is acting strange again. i asked *moms name* if she did this and she said she didn’t. does *uncles name* know what it means to stab someone? that they will die?” in the photo my aunt sent my grandma, the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is i’m not sure if it’s a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it, so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didn’t really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea it’s probably not safe. 

i don’t know if it was my uncle or mom either though, if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot, and we would yell and scream at each other (we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen, then we moved, then we moved again and he moved back in with us) but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. he’s very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet, and i can tell he doesn’t like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. we’ve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and that’s about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i don’t think he would want to kill me. on the other hand it’s possible that my mom was lying to my aunt, but from what i’ve seen i don’t think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way it’s more of a “this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him” type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again, they are both schizophrenic which i really don’t know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so that’s why i’m asking. 

i know it’s weird to ask about this on reddit but i really don’t have anyone to talk to about it. i’m not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and he’s a big guy i just don’t want to i feel like it’d be worse, and i don’t want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. i’m going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i haven’t been able to since she’s been asleep all night, but she’s just going to ignore me after i express my concerns, which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though we’re not really too close but yeah. 

another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it, didn’t deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything, i don’t have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i don’t have a job right now since i’m a full time student and i just don’t know where i would go. i don’t have any friends that would let me live with them either so that’s out of the picture . the best thing i’m hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but that’ll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just don’t know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldn’t be worried or what i should do so yea pls help",I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me,4

999," I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression.

its okay to say no.

dont surround yourself with people that drain your energy. its okay to let them go. this gives you more energy to focus on the good people and things in your life.

1005,"Hello,

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",Some advice to my people,4

1007,"Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.  Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.",Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged,4

But last night I asked them, told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times.

I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly.

1026,"(Gonna be a little long, gonna rant a bit)

Little back story, 20-year-old male, no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..

Last year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 6-7 days a week, confidence was high, and not a care in the world. I would say around May, I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on, it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year, I felt so detached, fatigued, and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head, it doesn't hurt, I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her.  I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me, and I went down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosing by reading google (i know worst idea ever). I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from (I still belive this), I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January, I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academy-type class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine, didn't eat breakfast, but drank 180mg of caffeine (I usually have \~300mg a day). During the afternoon portion of the class, I felt this sense of impending doom, and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest.  For 2 hours my HR was in the \~130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER, My EKG came back normal, sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate). They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro, and man oh man, hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me, constant panic attacks, SOB, tingling, the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack, Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again (like driving) to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house, not stressed at all, then my heart rate will kick off to the \~120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L  theanine, Ashwagandha, and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal?

A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose ""my concept"" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   


About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   


I did not think that way at first. At first I thought, ""I fucking hate everyone."" For a while. 

Then 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   


6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   


Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   


You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear.   


You can control your thinking!

I wish I could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. Moving the body oddly slow is not odd. Not speaking is an answer. And, you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out.

Today i went out with my friends and we had a good time but we ended up being outside a lot longer than we would and i got extremely cold and started panicking. We were far from everyone’s house and all i wanted was to go home. They came to my house afterwards and it was nice for a while but i was still feeling anxious. When they all left i felt immediately better like this huge weight on my chest being lifted off. it’s not that i don’t like my friends but being around people is so exhausting.

1057,"I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily.

1063,"So the preface, I’m someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years, occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dad’s door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills, taxes, or myself, that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they can’t stop themselves, but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene, my mom did physically attack  me (I didn’t get hurt, I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me).

Last night, she called me to ask if I could knock on my dad’s door, since he wasn’t responding to her calls, because she “needed to pay a bill.” I knew that this wasn’t just about a bill, so I compromised and sent him a text instead, I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasn’t going to call him/wake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency, as I would consider it to be rude to do so. 

She then says “don’t worry your little head about, go back to sleep or whatever, okay?” 

Then, she called me again, this time saying “What are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door.” I declined, saying I don’t want to be a part of whatever was going on between them, and she should talk to him about this, to which she said “I know. He’s your loving dad, and I’m the evil mom.” 

I said goodnight to her, she laughs and responded with “not goodnight. Good bye.” 

I say that I will talk to her tomorrow, and she replies “I’ll never talk to you again. Not tomorrow, not the next day, or the next.”

She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. 

She calls me one more time that night, here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door again:

“I ask you to do one simple thing, and you didn’t do it. It’s just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad, and he isn’t answering me. It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything! Translation: “Look at what I do for you! And yet, you can’t this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!”

“It’s not like you’re picking sides or anything!”

“You’re full of shit, just like him (my dad).”

“Where has your dad been all of your life?”

“You need to take responsibility.”

“Is this what one of your councilors told you to say, the one that I pay [x amount of money, I don’t exactly remember].”

“You don’t even know what is going on.”

“But fine. You can do whatever- go to sleep, wake up in the morning, do whatever you do.”

Me: “ok. Goodnight, mom.”

And finally, I said goodnight to her, and she said: “Don’t call me mom. Just say good night.”

That’s not to say my dads innocent either or anything - he’s hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well, so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically, they’re both each others abusers and victims, if that makes any sense at all. 

But I do believe he is the safer parent, as although he can, at his worst, make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him, as he is kind of an asshole at times, I don’t feel like my safety is threatened around him, unlike with my mom. He’s a lesser of two evils , if you will.

So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad, and my mom immediately associated me with him. So, now I’m afraid that when she comes home, she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad, or worse. I’m afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically.

It’s like I knew she would say yes, but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid she’d say something judgmental to me.

Hey r/anxiety, 

I am in a very tough spot rn, i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years, started my teaching certification programme (in my country you need to do this), but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain, diarrhea, insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job (like a 10 h job) in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services (the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me).
I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies (tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them, if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them, my divorced father had to pay me 112 € a month for instance) and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.
Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library (smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly) as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying, shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. 

As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days, i have lost 3 kg of weight, lack any appetite, have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country (we are in EU so travelling is no problem). I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it (i was paying my fam 250 € a month from the teacher pay), so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. 
I have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.

Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?

What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check",27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life,4

Whenever I open up and share my feelings my body feels physically sick and exhausted. Like it physically hurts. I feel so vulnerable like an open wound.  I basically start shaking and feel nauseous whenever I do share myself.


I’m terrified of opening up, whenever I do I,ll just get shamed or ghosted. It feels like hell because it’s hard enough to put myself out there in the first place.

It’s not even just deep stuff. Whenever I simply text someone I worry I’m bothering them and feel really embarrassed

1078,"Hello, I am new to this community, but I wanted some help. 

I’ll start with some context. I’ve always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse, with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadn’t eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS, but quitting weed didn’t really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.

This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. I’ve been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously  so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month (after about 1.5 month on SSRI) I have been doing better. I hadn’t thrown up for a month, but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like it’s going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.

1083,"The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn’t anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it’s because I started a new job last month and I’m falling back into my old health anxiety habits because “Stress compounds symptoms”. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven’t even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I’m fine I thought I’d be okay but I’m still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I’m calm it doesn’t go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can’t stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that’ll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It’s just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165.

1088,"I'm sorry, but this is a long one. It's a bit of a weird story but I'm hoping that someone might be able to give me advice on what to do. Just over a month ago, I (female, cashier) got a new coworker (male, bagger) at the grocery store I work at. It took a while before we had a conversation together; he was helping me and asked me what kind of music I like. I was honest, and said that I like most genres and that I sometimes enjoyed listening to 20s and 30s jazz music. Then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work. I don't like to talk much while I'm working because I feel like I mess up more when I do. So I began to feel anxious about being around him since I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other.

Then, a few days ago, he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working. I had a bad experience the last time I gave my number out to someone (the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we weren't, wouldn't stop calling me, tried to turn me against my family, etc.) and I immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we don't know each other at all. It felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me. I told him that we were busy and shouldn't be having that conversation right then (mainly because I didn't know how to say no in the moment) and that we could talk when we were done helping customers. But he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so. He ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me, telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off (this is while I was talking to a customer). Once we were done with all of the customers, I told him the truth: that I didn't want to give him my number and how I had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy I barely knew. He seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day. So I thought everything was going to be fine.

However, the next day, I started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me. He wouldn't be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible. He has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like he's supposed to; he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately. I often notice him watching me from across the room. Every conversation we have is awkward. I don't initiate them because I want him to leave me alone so I can work. When he's not talking to me, it seems like he isn't really talking to our other coworkers that much.

But then, the other day, I had a bit of a scary experience. I was going on break and went to our break room. He was in there and had headphones in, so I didn't think he saw me. After a few minutes, I went to the bathroom across the hall. When I came out a few minutes later, the room was empty.  I suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room, half-yelling my name just to show me a song from the 1800s for some reason. I'm worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me, which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now. I don't like being alone with him. Today, I spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom, worried he might bother me if I went anywhere else.

I know that the anxiety I feel isn't healthy, and I can't tell if I'm just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here. I don't know if I should talk to him, a manager, or HR about this. I thought that maybe I should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone, but I'm worried that it could just make things worse. I could really use some advice if anyone has some. Because I really can't tell if he's just trying to be friendly and doesn't realize he's making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on.",I am feeling anxious about a new coworker.

1089,"I (17F) am in my senior year of high school. I’ve sort of always been anxious, especially about people. Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about, even a little bit, I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. 

So, as I said, in high school. When I first started high school, life was a mess. What’s important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family, but that’s okay.

In my particular HS, we have a home room class, and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher, she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years, she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday, talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time, and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. 

This week, she’s been absent. Very strange. Then, on Wednesday, she says in a slide prepared for the sub that she’s out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasn’t planned, you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. 

I find out that she’s in the hospital, but fine. INSTANTLY, I’m full of anxiety, feeling like my soul was removed from my body. I’m just worried, like, a lot. I KNOW she’s fine, as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a “Get Well Soon” card, being given to her by another teacher she’s friends with. I don’t really know how to just patiently wait for the 3-4 weeks until she gets back. 

I’d also like to say that I KNOW she’s fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way, especially when I’m not actively doing something distracting.

Anyways, I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before.

I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought, does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable.

The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn’t eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn’t manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop.

1099,"Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself.

i've eaten too much, but a majority of what i've eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it (also in case this is needed information; i dont get sugar high).

idk if i can take nurofen or panadol (Panadol is a paracetamol i think, and i think nurofe contains ibprofen) for the headache because i'm on ritalin (methylphenidate) and Movox (Fluvoxamine, i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the US) and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox.

im also on a birth control to manage my periods (its called ""Evalyn"", i think im spelling it right, idk the science medication name off the top of my head though) but i know i can take pain killers with my BC. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol. 

the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly. does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it? ive drank lots of water (both for the stomach ache/ queasiness and for the headache) and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more, but it hasnt helped. just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too. i've thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and i've already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all, i've tried putting ASMR on too but that isnt making me sleepy.

would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not (using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safe)

i'm also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because it's really hard to find information online on my own.

1116,"Hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. After developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout, I mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes I get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest, I quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel well-prepared to take head-on, especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before, but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy, panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.

Specifically, I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fight/flight responses around takeoff and aviophobia, or *fears when the plane is in the air.* I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. 

But as I lay on my side writing this, I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.

I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10-minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.

It's crazy, I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. 

I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight, to sleep, to cry, to indulge in self-hatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now, but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today, because it was not going to get done.

1134,"Disclaimer, the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but I want to share this on many threads in order to get some help.   


I'm M 33years old:

[What's really interesting is, every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones I I have right now, so if you can please check them out so you understand what I am going trough.](https://www.reddit.com/r/costochondritis/comments/jrihv6/chest_pain_for_months_no_answers/?xpromo_edp=enabled)   


The only logical explanation I've found myself is, that it might be severe Anxiety or Burnout I've experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress.

As well some people, from what I've googled, claim that it might be side effect after a COVID infection (around June 2022), but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick (I got headaches and my throat hurt, her throat hurt and she was tired, both of us were 3x vaccinated). The only reason why I rule it out, is because these pains did start 2 days after my bed broke down while I was lying on it (August 2022) and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october 2022 but we've slept on the couch (that can be transformed into a bed) which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue (had a ""hole"" in the middle so had to change it) for almost 3 months.

Before this all happend, I was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and I was inactive during the lock down (2020) and after losing my job (june 2021), I've been almost every day on the PC (with bad posture probably) from 2019 - June 2022. (I got now a new job in september 2022 but got laid off from a previous one I was in for 3 months around January 2022)

Also I was on Amitriptyline 25mg for almost a year, and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than (June 2022), I used to have around 2021 iirc similar pains/tingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones I have right now.

I do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better, beside accepting our symptoms and live with them.  


I have the typical tingly, electric feelings around my left side, headaches, migraines, heart races, burning/cold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when I feel really anxious.  


Now all the symptoms seems to focus on Chest/Pain/Neck Pain with Brain Fog with, especially when the pains are strong.

  
The only relief I've found was lying down (tough sometimes I had moment where my back was blocked/stiffed but just for a short time and after I moved a bit), taking walks outside in the fresh air, being distracted, doing some stretching of the muscle where I have the pain.  


Yet what I hate is they all return.  
I've did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many Doctors, ER etc:  
dozens of Bloodtest came fine, have a slight Arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck (nothing seriously according to the doctors), Neurologe didn't found any anomaly, Cardio doctor in August/September 2022 told me my heart is totally fine (we did a stress test on a bike)   


So in the end, I really hope it's just my anxiety/burnout, as my doctors all say, who gave me all these physical symptoms. All I want is that these pains finally stop! And if I did write many confusing things, please tell me so I can clear it up.

August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so I’m thinking it’s a medication issue or lack of something. I’m mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since I’m not doing well lol.

1143,"This is probably a very particular issue and I’ve never really wanted to post about my anxiety but I’ve led myself here anyway. After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago, things have been pretty hellish for me. I’ve got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day (anxiety, of course), every day.  Now, I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. I’ve wanted to become a director for years now. As you’d imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I’ve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I’m a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I’ve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can’t see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you’re aware of the John Wick films, you know that they’re probably the most “foot on the gas” and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I’ve never had to leave the cinema. I’m pretty uncomfortable being there but I’ve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it. While I’ve been able to push myself to go all the other times, I just can’t see it happening this time. I know it’s a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all I’d really appreciate it.
Thanks :)",Going to the cinema,4

1147,"I'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. But in the past I increased my escitalopram dose a few times. I was really ""climbing the ladder"" dose-wise (I think that I had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the ""happy"" effect going) so I had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. I felt unbelievably great as I increased the dose. I took notes on my experience and I was just saying how great I felt and how I had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.

Antidepressants have been in use for a while now so I'm sure there's some wisdom about (1) whether being happy like that is sustainable, (2) whether it's healthy or not, and (3) whether I could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the ""dose ladder"" and gotten the effect to ""stick"".

Most importantly, when the ""happy"" effect was in place all my ADHD medications were working. This was absolutely life-changing. I can read in my notes that it says over and over ""if I could only maintain this level of healthy brain-functioning and ADHD-medication effectiveness then I would have a great life"". I wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that I had with the escitalopram and the ADHD medications; maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my ADHD medications.

I do have some anxiety/depression/OCD; I don't think that it's at the clinical level. I mean, I looked up the criteria for OCD and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day, so I'm far from that.

I've been dealing with my anxiety since I was 17. Since then, I've been looking for ""triggers"" that makes me feel more anxious. Like a pattern.

And Im better, actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. 

But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason, when I see them or talk with, I have a bad feeling, a heavy energy, and my anxiety explodes. Because of that, I cant trust on them.

Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders?  

I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a ""money induced paralysis"". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/v4qq6k/discussion_lack_of_motivation_induced_by_lack_of/) thread.  

It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort.  

I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind.  

I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach?

I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. 

I’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m at the end of my road",Nobody takes me seriously,4
1184," ""I don't feel very good, it's like I don't belong in this world (I don't think I ever did). My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it. Thank you for reading these few lines...""

I’m already panicking, as once the anxiety kicks in, I’m certain I’m going to forget everything I’m supposed to say.
